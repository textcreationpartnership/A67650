         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Eing my Lord of <hi>Winton</hi> is pleaſed to wipe off that odious aſperſion of his being a <hi>Papiſt</hi> [which myght in the late conjuncture haue coſt him his civil, &amp; endangered his natural life] by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring not only his judgment in matters of Religion; but alſo the grounds, on which it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyes, contained in ſeverall treatiſes, long ſince compounded, but never till now made publick: I preſume he will not be offended, that with the reſpect due to his quality of Peere of the Realme, theſe be reviewed. <hi>Reviewed,</hi> I ſay, for althô <hi>Appellations</hi> lye only to hygher, <hi>Reviſions</hi> are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to equal, or even inferiour courts.</p>
                  <p>He proteſts, he is no <hi>Papiſt:</hi> &amp; I think ſo too. I wish it were as eaſy to cleere him of <hi>Calviniſme:</hi> of which he ownes pag. XII. that he hath beene ſuſpected, &amp; to it he ſeemes enclined when he ſays, <q rend="inline"> that God by Miracles promoted the Jdelatrous worship of the Pictures, &amp; Relickes of Saints.</q> This I think in reality is to make God the <hi>Authour of ſin:</hi> Which <hi>Blaſphemy</hi> I do not beleiue the Church of England will owne, thô it be a choice flower in <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin's</hi> garden.</p>
                  <p>He declares his loyalty to the government eſtablisht, &amp; the Royal Family, &amp;c. And J beleiue him in this alſo: nay I judge as favourably of the greateſt part of his rank, &amp; moreover, that they are loyal not only for their <hi>Intereſt;</hi> but for conſcience, &amp; out of a ſenſe of their duty to God, their ſoveraigne, &amp; their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try: &amp; that he, &amp; they, will oppoſe, to their Power, <hi>Schiſme</hi> in the <hi>Church</hi> &amp; <hi>Faction</hi> in the <hi>State.</hi> Yet I think all their endeavours will
<pb facs="tcp:57387:3"/>be ineffectual to prevent ether, conſidering the conſtitution of the <hi>Proteſtant Church,</hi> &amp; qualifications of its <hi>Clergy.</hi> For as in ſome natural Bodyes there is a defect, which maugre all care of Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, cuts the thred of life, before it be ſpun to its ordinary length; ſo in ſome <hi>Bodyes Politick,</hi> that of the <hi>English Proteſtant Church,</hi> in particular. Here are ſome reaſons to proue this.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The firſt. <hi>Protestancy</hi> is a <hi>Schiſme,</hi> &amp; thoſe who liue in it, liue in a <hi>Schiſme.</hi> It is a <hi>Schiſme,</hi> becauſe it is a party ſeparated from the whole <hi>Catholick Church. Luther</hi> was a <hi>Schiſmatick,</hi> ſo was <hi>Calvin,</hi> ſo was <hi>Zuinglius,</hi> ſo was each Patriark of your Reformation: for each of theſe at their firſt breaking forth, left the <hi>Whole Catholick Church,</hi> or Congregation of <hi>Christians,</hi> of what denomination ſoever, not any one ſingle Perſon in the whole world, to whome he (or they) did joine himſelf. So that if ever any man was truly Schiſmatick, each one of theſe was ſuch. Wherefore all who joined to them, as all <hi>Proteſtants</hi> did, were <hi>Schiſmaticks.</hi> Now it is not probable that God will giue that greate Bleſſing of Eccleſiaſticall Peace, to <hi>Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks,</hi> who hate it, &amp; oppoſe it.</p>
                  <p>My 2. is: Proteſtants are <hi>Hereticks,</hi> that is <hi>Chooſers</hi> of the points, which they beleiue. For the <hi>Catholick Church</hi> delivered to her chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren not only, what they beleiue; but alſo many articles which they reject. Each Proteſtant takes this complex, examins it, &amp; finding ſome Articles not to pleaſe him, he caſts them out of his creede. Hence one rejects the <hi>Real preſence,</hi> another <hi>Free will;</hi> A third <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits;</hi> a fourth the <hi>Poſſibility of keeping God's Commandments,</hi> &amp;c. Each one culling out what Articles he pleaſes, &amp; compoſing of them not a <hi>Catholick;</hi> but a <hi>Proteſtant Faith:</hi> not a <hi>Faith</hi> of the <hi>Ghoſpels;</hi> but of this time, &amp; their <hi>Phancyes.</hi> What more evident ſignes of <hi>Hereticks?</hi> Now if they be ſuch, can we think them fit inſtruments to oppoſe <hi>Hereſy,</hi> who did introduce, &amp; do ſtill defend it? This shall be further confirmed, by my fifth Reaſon.</p>
                  <p>My 3. Proteſtants are a <hi>Cadmean</hi> broode, they ſprung out of the Earth armed: &amp; no ſooner did their ſoveraigne Lords ſee their faces, but they felt their Jron hands. Witneſſe <hi>Germany, France, Hungary, Bohemia, Scotland, swethland, Denmark,</hi> the <hi>Low countryes,</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:57387:3"/>&amp; <hi>Geneva.</hi> Our <hi>English Proteſtants</hi> ſay, they are not concerned in theſe Rebellions: but that is not tru, for by approving, &amp; applau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding them, they make them their owne, &amp; encourage the Practice, by commending the precedent. With what force can they teach Obedience to his Majeſty, who praiſe Rebellion againſt other? Or divert men from Treaſon, who transforme Traitors into Heroes, &amp; canonize Regicides?</p>
                  <p>My 4. There nether is, nor ever was any Authority vnder the Heavens better grounded than that of the <hi>Catholick Clergy</hi> conſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the <hi>Pope,</hi> &amp; <hi>Bishops,</hi> was before the Reformation. It was eſtablisht by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> ſetled by the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> ratifyed by general, &amp; particular <hi>Councils,</hi> confirmed by an vninterrupted Poſſeſſion of almoſt fifteene hundred yeares, backt by all Laws Eccleſiaſtical, &amp; Civil, &amp; acknowledged by all Chriſtians then aliue. What gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man can ſay ſo much for his eſtate? What officer, for his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity? What King, for his crowne? What Parſon for his Tith? What Proteſtant Bishop for his miter? When a <hi>Calvin,</hi> a <hi>Luther,</hi> &amp;c. to ſay no more, private men, ſtarte vp, declame againſt that Clergy, as a humane invention &amp; an Antichriſtian eſtablishment; &amp; you applaude them, &amp; with them trample vnder feete, the whole ſacred Order, &amp; teach your followers, no ſubmiſſion, no obedience is due to it. When you haue taught them to breake ſuch cables, can you expect to bind them to their duty with ſingle threds?</p>
                  <p>The English Proteſtant pretence to Bishops doth no ſatisfy, 1. Becauſe in reality they had no canonical ordination. as we ſay, &amp; proue. 2. Althô they had impoſition of hands, &amp; were real Bishops [which we deny. See Anti-Haman Chapt. xxxv.] yet <hi>They entred not by the doore; but climed vp ſome other way,</hi> Iohn X. 1. Were not promoted according to any canonical forme ether ancient, or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derne. Wherefore what can we judge of them, but according to Chriſt's words, <hi>Loco citato?</hi> 3. Your firſt Proteſtants promoted their Religion, &amp; Spreade their noveltyes contrary to all even <hi>English Bishops,</hi> &amp; in contempt of them, firſt in Henry VIII. his time, Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale, &amp; others. Secondly in Q. Elizabeths time, when all the Biſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hops aliue deteſted your Reformation, &amp; were for that ſtript of
<pb facs="tcp:57387:4"/>their juriſdiction, depoſed from their ſeates, &amp; confined. What wonder then your followers doe not regard that Croſier, which you haue broken, nor honour the Miter, which they haue ſeene you trample vnder your feate? Laſtly ſuppoſe your Bishops wereas va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidly, &amp; canonically conſecrated, as any ever were, can you ſay, that their Authority is better grounded, than that of all the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Clergy?</hi> Sure you cannot pretend to better grounds for your Authority, than our Clergy had. As it was than lawfull &amp; lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable to three, or four private men to contradict our whole <hi>Clergy</hi> then in being, why may not ſome private men amongſt you, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand yours? What reaſon can you alleadge againſt a Tub preacher? Some texts of ſcripture? Canons of Councils? Tradition of the Church? Laws of the Realme? All theſe ſtood in favour of our <hi>Clergy</hi> againſt the firſt <hi>Reformers,</hi> as, &amp; more, evidtntly than for you againſt your diſſenters. So your Schiſme &amp; Reformation hath deprived you of all meanes to preſerue the <hi>Peace</hi> of the <hi>Church.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>My 5. Is taken from the manner of your Reformation. From Rome our Anceſters had received by the ſame hands a ſyſteme of Faith, a body of Ceremonys, &amp; ſome Eccleſiaſtical Laws. The whole Faith as neceſſary to be beleived, the Ceremonys as decent to entertaine devotion. The laws as convenient to government, &amp; order. And your firſt Reformers changed all. Jn Faith they firſt rejected the whole vnwritten word, Tradition: &amp; a greate part of the written, ſcripture. They ſecondly perverted many places of this, by new interpretations, retaining the word without its ſenſe. The Ceremonys, &amp; laws were treated as licentiouſly, throwing out of dores whatſoever they pleaſed. Now why may not another imitate theſe your Patriarks? <hi>Cur non licebit Valentiniano, quod licuit Valentino, de arbitrio ſuo fidem innovare?</hi> What was lawfull to <hi>Luther,</hi> is ſure lawfull to a <hi>Lutheran:</hi> &amp; what was laudable in the ſixteenth, is not a ſin in the ſeventeenth age, to giue new interpretations to ſcripture, abolish other ceremonys, repeale more Canons. Eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally the motiues of reforming being common. Which is</p>
                  <p>My 6. Your firſt reformers rejected ſome Articles of Faith, as being delivered by fallible men: ſome Ceremonys as men's inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb facs="tcp:57387:4"/>&amp; ſome laws as contrary to Evangelical liberty. Now all this holds as ſtrongly againſt what they Keepe in, as what they leaue out: for all Canons were impoſed by men, all Ceremonys preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed by men, &amp; ſcripture it ſelf brought to you, &amp; continued amongſt you by fallible men, as much as the real preſence. Now as you blot this out of your creede, why may not another ſtrike out Baptiſme, a third the Trinity, a fourth the Incarnation, afifth the vnity of God, a ſixth the Deity it ſelf? &amp; ſo farewell all Faith. What reaſon is there, to ſay, that our Roman Miſſioners ſent by S. Gregory were infallible in delivering the myſterys of the Trinity or Incarnation, &amp; fallible, in ſpeaking of Purgatory, or the Real preſence? They ſay they pared away theſe Articles, becauſe they were not from the beginning &amp; were abuſes. But will not a <hi>Monothelit</hi> alleadge the ſame againſt the diſtinction of wills in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> an <hi>Eutychian,</hi> againſt the diſtinction of natures, a <hi>Neſtorian,</hi> againſt the vnity of Perſon in him, a <hi>Macedonian,</hi> againſt the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity of the Holy ghoſt, an <hi>Arrian,</hi> againſt that of the ſon, a <hi>Manichean,</hi> againſt the vnity of the Divine nature, a <hi>Iew,</hi> againſt the new Teſtament, &amp; a <hi>Libertin,</hi> and <hi>Atheiſt,</hi> againſt both old, &amp; new, &amp; God himſelf? Theſe are not wyre drawne concluſions, by obſcure mediums, &amp; far fetched illations; but natural, &amp; ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious ſequels of the fundamental principles of your Reformation, which are inconſiſtent with any conſtancy in Faith, and ſettlement in Church government. So I muſt conclude, that your <hi>Church buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding is ſuch, as no principles can beare; &amp; your principles are ſuch, as can beare no building.</hi> By which we may gueſſe, from whome your reformers had their vocation, from <hi>Abaddon, Apollion,</hi> the <hi>Deſtroyer,</hi> ſeing their principles are good only to <hi>Deſtroy Churchs;</hi> not at all to <hi>Build</hi> them.</p>
                  <p>In fine, a prudent man, without caſting a figure, might haue ſeene the fate of the late troubles, in their principles, which were inconſiſtent with any ſetled forme of civil gouvernment &amp; would ruin them all ſucceſſively, as they did, without any hopes of reſt, vnleſſe theſe were layd aſide, &amp; the juſt, &amp; ancient government reſtored. The like conjecture may be made of <hi>Proteſtantiſme,</hi> its
<pb facs="tcp:57387:5"/>principles being inconſiſtent with any ſetled forme of Faith, &amp; Church government, will deſtroy them all by Schiſme &amp; Hereſyes, &amp; no probability of a ſettlement vnleſſe theſe be renounced, &amp; the Ancient, Catholick, &amp; Apoſtolical Faith, &amp; Government reſtored. For a further proofe of this, I appeale to experience, (which is a demonſtration <hi>A poſteriori,</hi> as the former is <hi>A priori</hi>) which is</p>
                  <p>My 7. Experience shews, that tis much eaſier to deſtroy, than to ſettle a government ether in <hi>Church,</hi> or <hi>State.</hi> Nothing of Art, or Power was wanting to the eſtablishment of the <hi>Prelatical Church</hi> in <hi>England.</hi> She appeared firſt with the plauſible colours of an Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolical Reformation, was cherisht by Royal favour, armed the ſevereſt laws imaginable. Yet one age had not paſt over her head, when the peccant humours bread within her, layd her in the duſt, &amp; the crowne it ſelf with her, which it was hoped, she would vp hold. Both were againe reſtored: yet how ſoone was the joy of that over, &amp; both brought againe into a like danger? Seeke no where abroade the ſpring of theſe miſcheifes, they riſe from the Reformation, &amp; are inſeparable from the Proteſtant Church.</p>
                  <p>My 8. And laſt reaſon is drawne from the Proteſtant Clergy, it ſelf, which as it is modelled, &amp; principled, can never ſufficiently influence the Nation to preſerue its vnion in the Worship of God, &amp; its duty to the King: to prevent <hi>Schiſme</hi> in the <hi>Church,</hi> &amp; <hi>Fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> in the <hi>State.</hi> This appeares by experience. The reaſons I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue till ſome further occaſion be given.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. D. M. (ſo we shall hereafter call my Lord of Winton) ſays in his Preface pag. 11. <hi>A french Ieſuit called Mainbourg publisht ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mething as writen by her late R. H.</hi> &amp; he repeates afterwards four times in the Preface &amp; once in his poſt ſcript <hi>Mainbourg the Iuſuit:</hi> when it was <hi>Mainbourg the ſecular Preiſt</hi> who printed it. Which that booke of his tells all the world, ſo did the publike Gazets, contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning his diſmiſſion out of the ſociety. His ſuperiors did never per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit him to print it, whileſt he was a <hi>Ieſuit,</hi> knowing how ſacred the ſecrets of Princes ought to be. So that paper crept about only in written copyes, ſeene by few, &amp; of theſe not many beleiving it to be hers, whoſe name it beares. Now D. M. hath ſpreade it, &amp;
<pb facs="tcp:57387:5"/>the rumor of her Change in Religion, for his owne vindication, &amp; ſo prejudiced his mother the Church of England: for I doubt not but her R. H. example will moue more Powerfully to leaue that Church, than D. M. S. judgment, to retaine men in it.</p>
                  <p>He queſtions the Conference betwixt her R. H. &amp; the Bishop: which being a matter of Fact, muſt rely on the depoſition of wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, &amp; their credit, &amp; intereſt. She is poſitiue, he conjectural: she had no motiue, but Truth; he concerned for the honour of his Church, &amp; his owne. His topick is, if the Bishop anſwered ſo, he was nether ſo <hi>Learned,</hi> nor <hi>Conſcientious,</hi> nor <hi>Prudent,</hi> as he ought to be. Which many will eaſier grant, then that her R. H. in a matter of fact would wittingly tell an vntruth.</p>
                  <p>He relates many things in his Preface to little purpoſe. v. c. His coming out of <hi>England</hi> with 130. l. &amp; returning with as much, (as if he had the bleſſing of the <hi>Iſraelits,</hi> in the deſert whoſe cloths did not weare out) his ſerving his Majeſty, &amp; the Q. of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> without putting them to any charge, but his diet, his catechiſing their ſervants, &amp; preaching to them, his journy to <hi>Collen,</hi> &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to the Hague: &amp;c. what is the publick concerned in all this? Vnleſſe it be to helpe an Hyſtorian to write his life. But of heroical men even the Cradles, Rattles, &amp; Hobby horſes are venerable.</p>
                  <p>Pag. viii. He ſays, he did not convene with the french <hi>Hugonots,</hi> becauſe if <hi>They did not encourage, yet they did not, at leaſt had not, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned the rebellious proceedings of their Preſbiterian brethren in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland againſt the K. &amp; Church.</hi> Which implyes only their being idle ſpectators of that Tragedy, in which many think they were Actors for the worſe ſide: &amp; many English women in <hi>Geneva</hi> who followed their husbands thither at the end of the wars, were proofe enough. I will relate here what I find in Grotius his <hi>Diſcuſſio Rivetiani Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolici</hi> pag. 88. &amp; 89. where having ſayd, that the publick Peace is diſturbed by that Doctrine: <hi>Licita eſſe pro Religione ſubditorum in Reges arma,</hi> he adds: <hi>Hoc vir nobiliſſimus Pleſſiacus Mornaeus, tanquam pietati conſentaneum, teſtamento etiam ſuo inſeruit. Hinc ille motus Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baxianus, cum Reformatus Renauderius quoſdam ſui ſimiles in privatum conclave convocaſſet, &amp; dediſſet eis potestatem Ordinum Regni. Hinc

This booke hath beene printed neere theſe forty yeares: &amp; never any thing alleadged againſt theſe matters of fact, that I could heare of. How will <hi>Monſieur du Moulin Prebend of Canterbury</hi> reconcile with this Counſil of his Father, that letter, which he printed in his fathers name?</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Theſe treatiſes, having beene compoſed on emergent occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, without any ſetled deſigne, haue no other order than that of the time, they were compoſed in, amongſt thoſe of the ſame lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage. J deſigned once to draw the matters handled in them, into ſome method, which would helpe to their vnderſtanding. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that would make my Anſwer to D. M. leſſe ſatisfactory (a thing mainly aimed at) I tooke the eaſier way, to follow my Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour, as he leades me, ſtep by ſtep, without omitting any thing material. I omit in my Reviſion the letters of the Regular Preiſt, as not grounding the judgment, in matters of Religion, of D. M. as alſo D. M. his letter to <hi>Trigland,</hi> as containing nothing to our purpoſe. For it treates only two points: the 1. of <hi>Fact,</hi> that his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty really was a Proteſtant. To which no anſwer is neceſſary. The ſecond of <hi>Policy,</hi> that his Majeſty was to be reſtored to his Crowne by an Army of the ſtates. To this I cannot anſwer, as never ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving commenced Batchelour in Policy. Yet J will ſay, that God himſelf found a way to reſtore his Majeſty &amp; put an end to the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of the <hi>State,</hi> without Armes (contrary to the expectation of D. M.) And J hope [at leaſt it long hath beene, is, &amp; shall be my conſtant Prayer] that the <hi>God of Peace</hi> put an end to theſe contentious diſputes in the <hi>Church;</hi> that we all may come to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe but <hi>One sheepefold,</hi> vnder <hi>One sheperd.</hi> John X. 16. I thought once to omit his letter againſt F. <hi>Creſſey,</hi> as being cheifly perſonal: yet finding beſides a too ſevere charg on him, ſome Reflections vpon
<pb facs="tcp:57387:6"/>his whole holy Order, I tooke leaue to review the grounds of both, yet paſt it lyghtly, as entring vpon it vnwillingly.</p>
                  <p>That the Reader may with leſſe trouble ſee what the Doctor ſays, &amp; to what J anſwer, I giue his owne words, commonly at large, at leaſt their full ſenſe: &amp; J marke the page, where they are to be found. This makes my Reviſion ſomewhat longer: but that is compenſated with the eaſe of diſcovering the <hi>Truth,</hi> which both ſides pretend to, but only one ſide contends for ſincerely, the other oppoſes with all his Power. God grant to all a ſincere loue of <hi>Peace,</hi> &amp; <hi>Church vnion:</hi> &amp; then all theſe diſputes will ceaſe.</p>
                  <p>Poſt ſcript. What is contained in my fourth Booke, pag. 111. that <hi>Factious men</hi> were <hi>proſicients in the Art of promoting miſcheife,</hi> was written in march laſt, 1683. I little dreamed to ſee my conjecture confirmed ſo ſoone in ſuch a notorious manner, as it was by <hi>The Rye Plot,</hi> &amp; <hi>Blunderbuſſes.</hi> God hath miraculouſly both diſappointed, &amp; diſcovered thoſe Ruffians: J beſeech him, to grant, that the Roote, [at leaſt the pretext, or occaſion] of all theſe traiterous Practices, <hi>The hatred of jnnocent men, &amp; loyal ſubjects, may ceaſe.</hi>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE firſt Treatiſe, which occurr's in this collection, is <hi>the ſum of a ſhort Conference with a Ieſuit at</hi> Bruſſels. I leaue others to judg, whether it be an <hi>Historical,</hi> or a <hi>Poetical narration,</hi> or, whether it contains only ſincerely what was; or what might be, as not thinking it worth the while to enquire, eſpecially when we conſider, that certainly the greateſt part, &amp; poſſibly, all thoſe preſent who could inform vs, are dead. Thoſe who haue been acquainted with <hi>F. Darcy,</hi> &amp; know his great abilityes in controverſy, &amp; conſider how weakly he is made to anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, are apt to gueſs, that our Authour, Poet-like brings him, &amp; others, on the ſtage as he pleaſes, &amp; there makes him ſpeak, what is eaſieſt to be confuted. I rather incline to the contrary, that really there was ſuch a Diſpute &amp; ſuch things, in ſubſtance alleadged <hi>pro,</hi> &amp; <hi>con.</hi> Yet I muſt beg leaue to ſay, that J beleme the <hi>Doctor</hi> did not ſubtract any ſtrength, from his own, nor ad any, to <hi>F. Darcy's</hi> diſcourſe; it being but ordinary that things are ſo diſpoſed, in ſuch relations, as the <hi>Knight</hi> may kill the <hi>Gyant.</hi> Hence I regard little what that <hi>Father</hi> is reported to haue ſayd; but attend cheifly if not only, to what the Doctor alleadges againſt the <hi>Church,</hi> which I will defend to my power. We ſhall find his [D. Morley's] cheife
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:57387:8"/>Argument drawn from the <hi>Communion oſ Infants,</hi> by which he endeauours to proue, that the Church can erre, ſeing it hath erred which Vicount <hi>Falkland</hi> brought againſt the credit of our <hi>Traditions.</hi> Which hath been already anſweared, thô this is not taken notice of.

Morley <hi>coming to the</hi> Ieſuits Colledg, . . . <hi>found Father</hi> Darcy <hi>with the Lord</hi> Andover. 1. <hi>He received them very courteouſly, &amp; to ſatisfy their curioſitys, . . . very frankly made vs</hi> 2. <hi>a larg narratiue of their manner of liuing, lodging, diet, together with the hours of Riſing, ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dying, eating, &amp; recreations, &amp; of all the ſpiritual hours, &amp; exerciſes, they were bound vnto.</hi> 3. <hi>Things all of them in their ſeueral kinds, for the ſubſtance of them very commendable, &amp; worthy the imitation.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Reviſor.</hi> I eaſily beleiue, that <hi>F. Darcy</hi> very wel deſerved this publick teſtimony of his kindneſs, 1. becauſe he is known to haue been very ciuil to all men. 2. Becauſe I am informed that it always was, &amp; ſtill is the cuſtome of the <hi>English Ieſuits,</hi> to receiue cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſly, &amp; do all good offices for their country men, in all places, where they meet them: &amp; this not only to perſons learned, or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, whoſe qualitys, or qualifications may claim it as due; but alſo to others on no ſcore diſtinguishable from the meaneſt: which all thoſe can teſtify, who by deſign, or chance, paſs by their Colledges. And their kindneſs to their countrymen in diſtreſs, hath not been like that of thoſe who Iames 2.15.16. <hi>Seing their brother, or ſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:57387:8"/>naked, and destitute of dayly food, ſay vnto them, depart in Peace, be you warmed &amp; filled. But they haue giuen them thoſe things, which are needfull to the Body.</hi> I will not mention any, whoſe names, &amp; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitys are ſcarce known, but in their neighbourhood. Was <hi>Bedlow</hi> a Priſoner in Spain at <hi>Valladolid?</hi> the <hi>Ieſuits</hi> there labour to procure his liberty. Was <hi>Dangerfeild</hi> condemned to be hanged in the <hi>Low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countryes?</hi> The <hi>Ieſuites</hi> leaue no ſtone vnmoued to ſaue his life. Was <hi>Oates</hi> in want of all things neceſſary for food, &amp; rayment? He finds the <hi>Ieſuits</hi> purse open, &amp; hand ſtretcht forth to his releife: this he hath found in <hi>England, Spain,</hi> &amp; <hi>Flanders,</hi> as long, as there was any ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes of his amendment. And althô very often this <hi>Ieſuitical kindneſſ</hi> meetes with a <hi>Tru-Proteſtant gratitude,</hi> yet they continu ſtill the like good offices: ſo theſe proceed not from the compaſſion of ſome tender harted <hi>Ieſuits;</hi> but from the ſpirit of their order, which they ſuck in with the milk of <hi>Ieſuitiſme,</hi> confirm by practice, &amp; cheriſh with hopes of eternal rewards.</p>
                     <p>What <hi>Hoſpitals</hi> haue they not viſited, where they heard any of their deareſt countrymen lay ſick? Into what <hi>Dungeons</hi> haue they not procured entrance, if an English-man were caſt into them? what ſickneſs ſo loathſom, as to make the <hi>Ieſuits</hi> nauſeate the ſick? or ſo infectious, as to fright them away? what houſe for infection ſo ſhut vp from commerce with all men, as to exclude the <hi>Ieſuits?</hi> And what danger ſo great, as to deter a <hi>Ieſuit</hi> from running into the middle of it to releiue an Engliſh man in diſtreſs? How many of them haue deſtroyed their health, how many haue loſt their liues, in theſe works of <hi>Mercy?</hi> And how little haue the ſuruiuing <hi>Ieſuits</hi> been deterred from the like workes, by the euils befallen their Brethren, &amp; hanging over them ſelues? Haue we not ſeen the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous fable of <hi>Pilades,</hi> &amp; <hi>Oreſtes</hi> ſo renowned amongſt the <hi>Pagans,</hi> out don by a <hi>Ieſuit,</hi> who being indicted by the name of a <hi>Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictin,</hi> then preſent, he choſe rather to vndergo the ſentence of death, than to cleere himſelf by discovering the miſtake, &amp; by that, bringing the tru <hi>Benedictin</hi> into danger? The ſentence
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:57387:9"/>was not executed; it is tru: but that doth not diminiſh the eſteem due to the <hi>Ieſuits</hi> heroical reſolution, to ſuffer death himſelf, rather than auoid it, by occaſioning any danger to another. He ſaw death, &amp; an ignominious death according to the world, before his eyes, not to be auoided, but by a <hi>Reprieue,</hi> which he had nether meanes to ſollicit for, nor hopes to obtain, conſidering how punctually ſuch ſentences had been executed on others, not withſtanding all endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to get them ſuſpended. So his permitting the <hi>Verdict</hi> to be brought in, &amp; the ſentence to paſs vpon him, without making vſe of ſo certain, ſo obuious, ſo euident a meanes to trauerſe it, was to thruſt his neck into a halter, only to hinder his neighbour's danger of it. Was not this very litterally the perfecteſt charity, for one to giue his life for another?</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Whence proceedes this <hi>Zeal</hi> of ſouls, this alacrity to encounter any danger, how great ſoeuer, or difficulty [except that one of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending God by ſin] in theſe pious attempts? Anſwer: from their education, &amp; the practice of their whole life, from their entry into the <hi>Society.</hi> At their entrance knowing how little it would avail them to gain the whole world, with the loſs of their ſouls, &amp; in imitation of him, who being rich, for their ſakes became poor, for his ſake they renounce all they haue, &amp; all they hope for in this world. Their firſt two yeares, or <hi>Nouiceship</hi> is ſpent in meditating on the life, doctrine, &amp; death of <hi>God</hi> made <hi>Man,</hi> which aimes at nothing elſe, but the good of ſouls. And all their other exerciſes are to confirm them in the contempt of themſelues, the loue of god aboue all things, of their neighbour as them ſelues, &amp; in this <hi>Zeal</hi> of ſouls. At their entrance into the <hi>Nouitiate,</hi> they are obliged to make for a whole month, the ſpiritual <hi>Exercices:</hi> in which they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider firſt for what end, they, &amp; all men were created: <hi>Viz,</hi> to ſerue god in this world, &amp; enioy him in the next. That all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures what ſoeuer, Heauen, &amp; Earth, Beaſts, Birdes, &amp; Fiſhes, are deſigned as ſeruants to man, on his way to eternal bliſſ: that euen thoſe bleſſed Angels, ſo much our ſuperiours in nature, are
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:57387:9"/>but our ſeruants, being all Heb 1.14. <hi>Ministring ſpirits, ſent forth to miniſter for them, who shall be heires of Saluation.</hi> That all that <hi>God &amp; man, Chriſt-Ieſus,</hi> did, &amp; preacht, &amp; ſuffred Heb. 5.7. <hi>In the days of his flesh,</hi> was deſigned for that ſame great end, <hi>To ſaue ſouls.</hi> Now if god himſelf, the only competent Judg of the valu of ſouls, eſteemes them ſo much, how can we ſet too great a price vpon them? who wil regret any paines taken for their good, who hath before his eyes the trauels, the hunger, &amp; thirſt, the preachings, &amp; other labours of the <hi>Son of god?</hi> who wil be abasht at any dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in purſuit of ſo great a good, who ſees with the eyes of Faith Chriſt crucifyed, ſhedding the laſt drop of his bloud, &amp; ſuffring death, to purchaſe by it the life of ſouls? This in the <hi>Exercices.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>After that monthly <hi>Recollection,</hi> &amp; converſation with only god, &amp; his bleſſed <hi>Saints,</hi> their whole employments are ſuch, as may prepare them for that great work, the greateſt of all divine workes, as S. <hi>Denis</hi> ſays, To cooperate with God in the Converſion of ſouls. Do they pray? It is to vnite themſelues the cloſer to Almighty God, that ſo they may be fitter inſtruments for him to work with, &amp; encreaſe the Zeal of ſouls. Do they ſtudy? It is to render themſelues more capable to aſſiſt them. Do they Teach Do they Preach? It is to direct men to Heauen by declaring to them ſauing Truths. Their recreations, eating, drinking, ſleeping aim at the ſame end; for by them they conſerue, or repayr their ſtrength, that they may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu to ſerue god, &amp; their neighbour. Thus all the actions of each day, month, year, &amp; their whole life are employed in procuring the ſalvation of themſelues, &amp; their neighbour.</p>
                     <p>They riſe at Four in the morning, with their harts full of grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude to god, who hath preſerued them that night; &amp; petitions for a bleſſing on their Actions that day. At four and a halfe they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin their meditation, or mental <hi>Prayer</hi> which laſts for a whole hour, on ſome paſſage of the life, or point of doctrine of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Then they ſay or hear <hi>Maſſe:</hi> which being a Commemoratiue <hi>Sacrifice</hi> of that, on the croſs, renews the memory of what god did, &amp; ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:57387:10"/>to ſaue ſouls: &amp; conſequenly renews Zeal to procure it. The reſt of the morning is ſpent either in mental, or vocal Prayer, or ſtudy, or dealing with their neighbor, according to the order of <hi>Superiors,</hi> or preſent occaſions. Only one quarter before dinner is aſſigned for a ſeuere review of their Actions, of the whole mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, &amp; taking a ſtrict Account of them all, in the preſence of god. For what they find well don, they giue thanks to god, the Authour of all good: for what is reprehenſible, they ask God par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, &amp; endeauour to diſpoſe themſelues to receiue it, by a true ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row for hauing offended him, &amp; a ſtrong reſolution neuer more to offend him. Dinner is followed with a <hi>Recreation</hi> (as they call it) for an hour, which is ſpent in diſcourſes of pious things, or others indifferent. The reſt of the afternoon till ſupper is ſpent as the morning [except <hi>Maſſe,</hi> &amp; the firſt hour of Prayer.] After ſupper one hour is allowed for mutual converſation: then the great <hi>Lita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyes</hi> of all <hi>Saints</hi> are ſayd by all together, which laſt about a quarter: a ſecond quarter is aſſigned to prepare the morning's meditation: a third for the <hi>Examen</hi> of their conſcience, &amp; the laſt to go to bed: which all muſt do by nine. This is their ordinary diſtribution of time, for the whole day. Which I hear was exactly obſerved by the <hi>Ieſuits</hi> during their cloſe impriſonment, to the aſtonishment of their keepers, who could not tell how they could ſo regularly do all thoſe ſeveral pious Actions at the ſame hours, hauing no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication with one an other: they did not, they could not know, that this was the diſtribution of time vſed in their <hi>Colleges.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I need not ſay, that each one hath a chamber to himſelf which ſerues as much for modeſty as conuenience: that this is fitted [as that of <hi>Elizeus,</hi> or <hi>Elisha</hi> 4 Reg. c. 10 by the <hi>Sunamite</hi>] with things neceſſary for vſe; without ſuperfluitys: that their diet is frugal, without daintys: &amp; their whole way of liuing is decent, &amp; neate; without ether vanity, which they abhor; or ſordidneſſe, in the Pouerty, which they profeſs. In one thing they think they cannot be too prodigal; in their churches, their Altars, their ſacred Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:57387:10"/>&amp; veſtments. They know God to be the King of Kings, &amp; Lord of Lords: &amp; adoring him aboue all the world they think it all too little for him. Wherefore whatſoeuer they can procure by themſelues, or by their freinds, they employ freely in the <hi>Diuine ſeruice.</hi> From the ſplendour of their churches, ſome ſtrangers to their manner of liuing, gueſs them to be exceeding rich whereas did they know all, they would correct that errour. At <hi>Bruges</hi> they haue a noble church; &amp; but a pittifull building for their own aboad. They are though't to flourish as much in <hi>France,</hi> as in any part of <hi>Europe:</hi> yet a ſtrict ſuruey being made of all their reuenues vnder the French dominions by order of his moſt Chriſtian Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, they were found not to haue two hundred French <hi>Liuers</hi> per annum, <hi>In ſingula Capita.</hi> Whereas ſome other very auſtere &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Religious Orders, &amp; who are not noted as rich, haue accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the ſame ſurueyours aboue 1300. liuers, <hi>In ſingula Capita.</hi> Hence is euident, that diſcourſe of <hi>Ieſuits</hi> riches is an effect of malice in ſome, &amp; of ignorance in moſt men.</p>
                     <p>This J ſay to ſupply that part of the Conference, which you only hint at, by the words aboue cited, that <hi>He,</hi> that Father, <hi>Made a larg narratiue of their manner of liuing, &amp;c.</hi> This <hi>Narratiue,</hi> had you giuen it to the publick, would haue giuen greater ſatisfaction, than mine, becauſe the <hi>Father</hi> had greater experience, than J haue. Howeuer J do not fear to be blamed in the whole, or any part of this relation, ſo great a confidence J haue in thoſe Informations J rely on.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Hence I am not much ſurpriſed, to ſee you approue theſe Actions, as <hi>Very commendable, and worthy the Imitation for the ſubſtance of them.</hi> A perſon of ſo quick a wit, &amp; ſo ſolid iudgment, could not haue any other opinion of them. Yet J dare you to ſquare theſe circles, or reconcile theſe contradictions: <hi>the Actions of</hi> Ieſuits <hi>are for the ſubſtance of them commendable.</hi> And: <hi>the Cheife action of</hi> Jeſuits <hi>is not commendable,</hi> viz, the <hi>Maſſe,</hi> which you, &amp; your Brethren hold to be downright <hi>Idolatry.</hi> Now <hi>Maſſe</hi> is not only one
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:57387:11"/>of the <hi>Ieſuits</hi> religious Actions; but it is the very Cheife of them all. For as in the old law all its rites, ceremonys &amp; ſacrifices were but figures, or types of the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> of the <hi>Croſs</hi> which was deſigned from the beginning, &amp; which being intentionally preſent in God's vnderſtanding did moue his goodneſs euer ſince <hi>Adam's</hi> fall to pardon men's ſins &amp; grant them thoſe Bleſſings, to which, in vertue of that <hi>Sacrifice</hi> they had a right, on which account the true Lamb of God is ſayd to be <hi>Occiſus ob origine mundi</hi> Apoc. 13.8. <hi>Sacrificed from the beginning of the world,</hi> ſo in the new all our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotions, all our prayers, all our pennances, our interiour, &amp; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriour vertuous Actions, regard the ſame ſacrifice of the <hi>Croſs,</hi> &amp; that of the <hi>Maſſe,</hi> which is a commemoration, or repetition of that other of the <hi>Croſs.</hi> So all our deuotions are only as prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to it, or Thanks giuings for it, &amp; the graces we receiue by it. Thus in the natural Body all Actions vegetatiue &amp; ſenſitiue proceed from the head, &amp; hart, &amp; are cheifly deſigned to nourish, helpe, &amp; defend them: &amp; in the myſtical Body, of Religious Actions, &amp; Dutys they all proceed from, &amp; end in the Bloudy Sacrifice of the Croſs, &amp; in the vnbloudy ſacrifice of the <hi>Maſs,</hi> for as much as in them is contained our bleſſed ſaviour <hi>CHRIST-IESVS God bleſſed for euer more,</hi> the Α, &amp; Ο, <hi>Beginning &amp; end</hi> of our Religion, in whom all our Devotions concenter, he being the Founder, &amp; Authour of our <hi>Faith,</hi> the Ground, &amp; Anker of our Hope, &amp; the Principle &amp; Object of our <hi>Charity. Which three vertues are Cheifly, or rather ſolely aimed at in Religion. Haec ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ximè, imo vero ſola in Religione ſequenda ſunt.</hi> Aug. Enchir. c. 4.</p>
                     <p>Now if <hi>Moſs</hi> the cheifeſt, &amp; nobleſt of Religions Actions be <hi>Idolatry,</hi> as you ſay elſewhere, how do you ſay now it is <hi>Lawfull,</hi> nay <hi>Commendable,</hi> &amp; <hi>Worthy the imitation?</hi> If it be ſo, certainly it is not <hi>Idolatry.</hi> But Contradictions are vnavoidable, when we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate a known truth, which by ſurpriſal will force an acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it ſelf, altho we arm our ſelues againſt it when advertiſed.

                     <p n="1">1. Reviſor. Altho I readily grant the capacity of that noble man to be great; yet I muſt beg leaue to dout, whether he were a competent Judg of the moſt ready way to end the <hi>Differences</hi> in points of <hi>Faith</hi> betwixt diſſenting <hi>Churchs:</hi> this requiring a greater ſearch into points of <hi>Doctrine,</hi> &amp; <hi>intereſt,</hi> then Perſons of his quality, &amp; education are willing commonly to vndergo. <hi>Truth</hi> is ever pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended on both ſides; but it is onely pretended on the one ſide, which in reality applyes all its induſtry to ſuppreſſe it, for ether mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of <hi>Paſſion, Intereſt, Envy, Spite, Reveng,</hi> &amp; what elſe is contrary to the law of God. When theſe poſſeſſe the hart, the head is buſyed to make Vertu paſs for vice, &amp; vice for vertu,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:57387:12"/>to adorn Falshood with the dreſs of Truth, &amp; by ſophiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal reaſons make Truth be ſuſpected of Falshood. He will by calumayes as black as Hell, reader odjoas, or contemptible the perſons, who oppoſe his Paſſion, &amp; thwart his Jntereſt, Croſs his deſign, &amp; procure his real good, by diſcovering his errours, &amp; by that inviting him to return to the ancient Faith, &amp; Communion of the <hi>Church,</hi> which he broke through want of <hi>Charity.</hi> It is hard to diſcover the wiles of thoſe Foxes, &amp; ways of theſe wolves, the fraudulent, or fierce enemys of the Churchs Peace; to ſee through that miſt which they raiſe on purpoſe not to be ſeen, &amp; to fathom theſe <hi>Depths of Sathan.</hi> Apoc. 2.24. Now thò this noble man's ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity was great, yet perchance not ſufficient for ſo obſcure, &amp; intricate a work.</p>
                     <p>Yet when all the doubling of theſe Foxes are diſcovered, &amp; the ſecrets of their harts layd open, yet the work is not half don. The greateſt difficulty remaines, to wean them from thoſe beloved wandrings: it being one of the diſmalleſt effects of theſe ſinfull errours, that by ſecret, yet power full charmes, they fix the will in the loue of them. Hence S. Proſper. Tantum nocet error</p>
                     <l>Vt juuet errare, &amp; veteris contagia morbi</l>

                     <p>The ſecretary of nature <hi>Aristotle</hi> never div'd deeper into the hart of man, then when he ſayd, that althô Reaſon ſeemes to hold the ſcales, &amp; diſcern betwixt two contending parts, yet in reality it is the hart, the will, which deliberates, &amp; decides the thing in queſtion. Hence comes that variety of judgments on the ſame indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual Action, of which one shall make a <hi>Panegyrick,</hi> another a <hi>Satyre.</hi> And thô the <hi>lyght</hi> of Truth, &amp; the appearance of God, be ſo cleer, as not to be concealed, yet this shall be as ineffectual,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:57387:12"/>as to all influence on our Actions, as if they were dreames, a ſenſual man prefers Pleaſure before his Honour; A vertuous man the contrary. So we judg [as we are affected] not as we should: our will doth not follow, but lead nay drag after it our Reaſon, &amp; that with ſo ſweet a violence, that it is not perceived without much labour, great attention, &amp; ſtrict ſearch into the beginning, progreſſe, &amp; end of our Actions. This is the root of all incohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent diſcourſes, &amp; illogical deductions of Paſſion, &amp; intereſt or ſelf-loue, which in many prevail over Truth, controul the incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations to good, &amp; make men break all their dutys to God &amp; their country, to Prince, frends, &amp; Relations: &amp; thô they ſee what is better, yet do the contrary. <hi>Video meliora proboque Dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riora ſequor.</hi>

                     <p>This difficulty ſeemes invincible, when ſtrengthned with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, which Proud Ring'eaders find in having their followers harts at a beck, &amp; being eſteemed by them, as <hi>Oracles:</hi> a ſatisfaction ſayd St <hi>Francis Bacon</hi> as much aboue that of <hi>Tyrants,</hi> as mens ſouls are aboue their Bodys. In the whole black liſt of <hi>Hereſiarks</hi> only two occur to my mind, who truly repented, viz, <hi>Eutichius</hi> Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ark of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> who denyed the Reſurrection of the Flesh, &amp; was converted by S. <hi>Gregory</hi> our Apoſtle, &amp; <hi>Berengarius</hi> Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triark of the <hi>Sacramentarians</hi> Only theſe two to my remembrance dyed well, profeſſing the tru Faith contrary to their ſeveral errours.

                        <hi>Condemned of themſelves,</hi> or knowing that they deſerved condemnation: &amp; doubtleſſe all felt thoſe reproachs of conſcience which follows all guilty Actions: yet Pride hardened their harts againſt all. Now what can work vpon theſe men in order to their Converſion? ſet before theyr eyes Truth? they know; but will not acknowledg it. Reproach vnto them their perfidious abandonning God, and his ſpouſe the Church? the Holy Ghoſt doth it inwardly, &amp; they ſlyght him. Threaten Hell, &amp; damnation, to torrify them?
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:57387:13"/>They are ſelf condemned, &amp; yet are vnconcerned, this oppoſing known Truth, is a ſin againſt the Holy ghoſt impoſſible to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given, becauſe it is morally impoſſible to be repented. This is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by Reaſon, confirmed by experience &amp; delivered by the Apoſtle.

Theſe (nether having the guilt of a ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt vpon their Conſcience, nor their ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hardned againſt the Call of God) we hope may be reclaimed: And a <hi>Conference</hi> ſeverally to ſuch, as theſe, may proue beneficial: Though not to the whole body of <hi>Separatiſts,</hi> vpon which the more factious heads will always haue too great an influence.</p>

Thus <hi>Melancthon,</hi> &amp; <hi>Bucerus,</hi> who were eſteemed <hi>Moderate,</hi> could effect nothing at the ſeveral meetings to which they were deputed.</p>

And 2. would aſſuredly ſtand to that Power. Do we not ſee, that a ſeparation is firſt reſolved on, &amp; errours ſought out &amp; alleadged only to colour it? Did not <hi>Luther</hi> laugh at the labour — in — vain of the <hi>Catholicks,</hi> who confuted his errours, ſaying that before they had diſpacht the old ones, he would find them more worke, by broaching new? And how often are the ſame objections renewed,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:57387:14"/>after a full &amp; ſatisfactory anſwer? That, for example, of <hi>Pagan Idolatry,</hi> reproached to vs lately by E. S G. B. &amp; R. C. but anſwered ſo home by T. G. &amp; W. E. that it will be layd aſide, till theſe are forgotten: &amp; then we may expect to ſee ſome huffing miniſter thunder all the curſes of ſcripture from the beginning of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> to the end of the <hi>Apocalypſe</hi> againſt the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> as guilty of the very <hi>Pagan Idolatry?</hi> Thus <hi>Trita haereticorum arma colligunt.</hi> Says S. Proſper, <hi>They take vp the broken weapons of their brethren.</hi> As ſome rivers paſs vnperceived for ſome ſpace vnder ground, &amp; then riſe again: ſo that, ſo other Objections againſt the <hi>Church.</hi> And if J am not miſtaken in the <hi>Horoſcope</hi> of this Argument drawn from ſenſe againſt <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> it will run the ſame fate, for while a loue of ſeparation continues, theſe or ſome other pretexts will be vſed to excuſe it.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore <hi>The only meanes to put a good end to all Diſputes in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, is to procure a ſincere Loue of Peace, &amp; mutual communion.</hi>

Beſides many points of diſcipline, which thô leſſe conſiderable, than thoſe of Faith, yet are not to be
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:57387:15"/>neglected, which no <hi>Church of England man</hi> will deny ſeing he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fends thoſe retained in it againſt the <hi>Presbiterians.</hi> If theſe be <hi>Small points,</hi> what are <hi>Great?</hi> And if theſe be not <hi>Many,</hi> what Here<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſy ever had many? It will not be enough to ſay, the <hi>Church of England</hi> doth not oblige her Children to beleiue all theſe: for shee ownes Communion with thoſe, who do, &amp; abetteth her children, when they reproach vs, with the contrary Truths.</p>
                     <p>But ſuppoſe there were but <hi>Few,</hi> but <hi>One difference,</hi> &amp; that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable in it ſelf, yet if it cauſes a <hi>Schiſm,</hi> it deſtroys all hope of <hi>Salvation.</hi> Now what comfort is it to a wounded man, to tell him, he hath but one wound, &amp; that not great, if that touch the hart, &amp; is mortal? The <hi>Novatians,</hi> the <hi>Miletians,</hi> the <hi>Quarted ci mans,</hi> the <hi>Donatiſts,</hi> &amp;c. were tru <hi>Schiſmaticks,</hi> &amp; could not be ſaved altho each of them differred from <hi>Catholicks,</hi> but in one point, &amp; that not of <hi>Faith;</hi> but of <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Diſcipline.</hi> And they were as obſtinate in the defenſe of that one, as others in that of many great ones. The fewer, &amp; leſſe conſiderable the points are, betwixt vs, &amp; the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> the greater is their guilt in dividing Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion on that ſcore.</p>
                     <p>All ſpiritual &amp; temporal juriſdiction, the Authority of Prelate, &amp; Prince, is derived from the ſame fountain, God. <hi>There is no power but of God, &amp; the Powers that be, are ordained of God.</hi> Rom. 13.1. The ſame perſons are ſubject to both <hi>(Let every ſoul be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to hygher Powers)</hi> And this out of the ſame principle of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. <hi>Who ſoever therefore reſiſts the Power, reſiſts the ordinance of God . . . . Wherefore ye muſt needes be ſubject not only for wrath; but alſo for conſcience ſake.</hi> The ſame motiues are alleaeged to excuſe the Diſobedience to both, Abuſes in government, heavy &amp; vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary Impoſitions, greivances, &amp;c. The ſame pretexts ſerue to make the Rebellious Actions againſt both plauſible; Evangelical Liberty, Reformation, Reeſtablishment of ancient forme of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, &amp;c. Stubbor neſſe in the Rebellious is covered with the ſame fig-leaues, Complaints of greivances not harkned to, petitions
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:57387:15"/>for Redreſſes vnregarded, humble Addreſſes not effectual. Alike Art vſed, to conceal a reſolution never to be ſatisfyed, what ever Anſwer be returned: for if one requeſt be granted, they will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand more: if denyed, than they perſwade their followers, they are ſlyghted, that no good can be hoped from ſuch perſons, &amp; that things muſt be redreſt without them. Then they teach that all Power is derived (not from God, as the Apoſtle ſays) but from the People: that their ſuperiours are only their Commiſſioners, &amp; accountable to them, &amp; theſe having abuſed their Power, may, nay ought to be deveſted of it. And ſo they proceed to change the eſtablisht Government in Church &amp; ſtate: alleadging the Bible, as the Rule of their Actions againſt the Head of the Church, &amp; ancient Statutes, thoſe againſt the Prince, yet wreſting both to their capricios; not framing theſe to thoſe. In reality making all Government in Church &amp; ſtate ſubſervient to their Intereſts. All which are written with a ſun beame in the Hyſtorys of our civil wars in <hi>England,</hi> &amp; thoſe of the firſt Reformation in <hi>Germany, France, Scotland,</hi> &amp; <hi>England</hi> too.</p>
                     <p>So chang in Church &amp; ſtate are begun with lamentations, &amp; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moanings of the People greived, &amp; overcharged: carryed on with Humble Addreſſes &amp; Petitions: &amp; end in confuſion &amp; deſtruction.</p>
                     <p>Hence it appeares how dangerous it is for a Prince to counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance thoſe Pretences to Liberty againſt the Prelate, with in his dominions. What is ſawce for à goos, is ſawce for a gander. Both hold their Authority, on the ſame renure: what ſtrikes at one, wounds the other. That Principle which shakes the miter, endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers the Crown, who breakes the <hi>Crozier</hi> would crack the ſcepter: for both are made ſacred by the ſame divine Ryght. Soe who dares oppoſe the one, is diſpoſed to shake hands with his duty to the other: The differences betwixt them, being no other, but only, as of more, &amp; leſſe in the ſame kind.</p>

But you haue a ſting in the end; when you reject all the fault, all the oppoſition of ſo great a good, as the <hi>Peace of the Ch.</hi> on vs. <hi>Who are reſolved to remit nothing.</hi> A very vncharitable, &amp; rash judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And vntru to boote, as appeares by F. <hi>Darcys</hi> reply &amp; by that ſtory which <hi>Proteſtants</hi> with great confidence relate in Q. <hi>Eliſabeths</hi> time, viz, that the Pope offred to confirm all she had don in Church affayres, vpon condition she would acknowledg
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:57387:17"/>him. How can you ſay <hi>We will remit nothing,</hi> when your Brethren aſſure the Pope was ready to remit all? But it is your fashion, to ſay, &amp; vnſay, as you think for your preſent purpoſe. Then it ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved your turn, that the Pope did not diſlike your <hi>Reformation,</hi> to moue <hi>Catholicks</hi> to embrace it, &amp; ſo you ſpread that report. Now it is to your purpoſe to throw the odium of the diviſion on the <hi>Popes inflexibility:</hi> &amp; ſo you report that. The tru, &amp; only reaſon, that the ſchiſmatical Party is reſolved never to reſt ſatisfyed, with what is remitted. So the rebellious Part of the Parliament reſolved never to be ſatisfyed with what ſoever anſwer the King gaue to their Addreſſes: &amp; for that Reaſon we might ſay, all Treatys for peace betwixt the King &amp; Parliament would proue ineffectual.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. F. <hi>Darcys</hi> anſwer shews how deſirous the Church is to reſtore <hi>Peace</hi> to <hi>Chriſtendome,</hi> being ready, for ſo great a good, to remit of her Ryght in impoſing ceremonys, &amp; making Canons. In <hi>Faith</hi> she can change nothing, that belongs to a higher Tribunal, she receiues it from her ſpouſe, in the nature of a <hi>Depoſitum,</hi> (1. Tim 6.20.) which muſt not be altred. But <hi>Eccleſiastical Diſcipline,</hi> being lef to her determination, &amp; of her own appointement, she may change, &amp; as the Father ſayd, will change, if by that meanes she could reſtore to the sheep-fold of <hi>Christ,</hi> all his ſtrayed sheep. This is more than the <hi>Ch. of Engl.</hi> will do: ſeing to reclaime her vndutiful children she will not omit the ſigne of the Croſſe in Baptiſm, kneeling at the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, &amp; bowing to the Altar, all ceremonys of humane jnſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, &amp; her own injunction. Nay she would not alter ſome words in her <hi>Lyturgy,</hi> to purchaſe Peace.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. If the <hi>Church diffuſivè,</hi> that is all <hi>Chriſtians</hi> in all places can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not erre, wo be to the firſt <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> whoſe ſentiments in matters of <hi>Faith</hi> were as contrary to thoſe of all <hi>Chriſtians</hi> in all places, as to thoſe of the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> except that one point of <hi>Papal Power.</hi> So if all <hi>Chriſtians</hi> did not, &amp; cannot erre, the firſt <hi>Proteſtants</hi> did erre; &amp; all their followers doe erre, &amp; will erre, as long as they retain thoſe ſentiments: for what is an errour to day, will be
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:57387:17"/>ſuch to morrow, &amp; to the end of the world.</p>
                     <p>As to the <hi>Communion of Infants:</hi> J acknowledg, that for a long time when <hi>Baptiſm</hi> was adminiſtred ſolemnly by <hi>Bishops</hi> to men grown vp, <hi>[Adultis]</hi> two other Sacraments were adminiſtred with it <hi>Confirmation,</hi> &amp; the <hi>Euchariſt.</hi> That when it was adminiſtred by <hi>Preiſts,</hi> they were ordred to anoint the baptiſed perſon not on the forehead; but on the crowne. That when <hi>Infants</hi> were bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, becauſe the Sacrament could not without danger, be adminiſtred to them vnder the ſpecies of Bread alone, it was giuen vnder the other ſpecies, the Preiſt dipping his finger into the Holy Chalice, gaue it them to ſuck or a litle particle of the ſpecies of Bread ſoaked in the conſecrated wine was layd on their tongue. That the Communion was giuen to <hi>Infants</hi> out of an opinion, that it was neceſſary to ſalvation grounded on thoſe words of <hi>Chriſt</hi> Ioan. 6. <hi>Vnleſſe ye eate the Body . . . . you haue no life in you.</hi> I grant alſo that ſome, &amp; haply many in ſome private Churchs beleived that to be the litteral meaning of thoſe words, &amp; thought conſequently that ſenſe was <hi>De fide,</hi> a point of Faith. Yet I deny, that the vniverſal Church did erre in declarations, or definitions of Faith: for indeed she never made any definition in this matter. That Text was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed with the reſt of Holy writ to the view of all <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> &amp; left to the interpretation of ordinary <hi>Paſtors,</hi> as the reſt was. Many vnderſtood it litterally, &amp; for that reaſon extended to <hi>Infants</hi> the Communion in <hi>Baptiſm</hi> ordained to men enjoying the vſe of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. The Church ſeing no preſſing inconvenience in this cuſtome, &amp; conſequently no neceſſity to make a ſevere examen of the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of thoſe words, &amp; a cenſure of an jnnocent errour, permits them to go on, without interpoſing her Authority, or by any le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal definition obliging her children to beleiue either the one, or the other part. And I doubt not, but there are ſeveral other texts of ſcripture commonly vnderſtood one way, &amp; that thought to be the litteral meaning, &amp; tru ſenſe, &amp; followed as ſuch, &amp; ſome nay many, may beleiue that ſenſe to be <hi>De fide,</hi> &amp; the Church
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:57387:18"/>permits them to beleiue, &amp; practice ſo, [not ſeing any neceſſity to call a General Council to decide it, the errour being nether deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tructiue to neceſſary Faith, nor good manners] &amp; yet this ſenſe may be different from that the Holy Ghoſt cherfly intended by thoſe texts: &amp; all this without any prejudice to the <hi>Church</hi> of Rome's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility, which never declared any thing in it. Such I think is the common way of explicating <hi>Anti Christ</hi> to be one ſingle man: &amp; the three yeares &amp; a halfe, to be litterally vnderſtood, for forty two months vulgar. From alike occaſion the error of the <hi>Chiliaſts,</hi> or <hi>Millenarians</hi> had its riſe, &amp; progreſſe: which was not condemned, till its Abettars, grew troubleſome to thoſe, who differed from them in the expoſition of thoſe words, Apoc. 20.4. on which they groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded their error.</p>
                     <p>Hence it ſo lows that what <hi>Maldonate</hi> says makes nothing againſt the Churchs infallibility in defining things of Faith, for he nether ſays, nor could ſay with truth, that she ever defined any thing in this matter. And the practice it ſelf of communicating Infants can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be proved to be vniverſal, or in vſe in the Roman Church. Some think the <hi>Pelagians</hi> introduced that cuſtome: &amp; that S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> proues thence the neceſſity of <hi>Baptiſm argumento ad hominem</hi> By a reaſon drawn from their own ſentiments. The ſame I ſay of <hi>Binius,</hi> &amp; S. <hi>Austin:</hi> for both ſpeake of the practice which they found, without citing any publick decree, for indeed there was none ever made, even by <hi>Innocent</hi> I. whom you cite. For the place you mean is in his anſwer to a letter written to him by the Fathers of the Council of <hi>Milevis</hi> in <hi>Africa,</hi> which had condemned <hi>Pelagius</hi> &amp; <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtius,</hi> who taught there was no need of the grace of God to keep the commandments, &amp; that children myght be ſaved without <hi>Baptiſm. Innocent</hi> approves their decrees: &amp; proves none can be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved without <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> becauſe none can be ſaved <hi>Without eating the Body, &amp; drinking the Bloud of Chriſt.</hi> And he addes: <hi>Qui vitam ijs ſine regeneratione defendunt, videntur mihi ipſum baptiſmum velle caſſare cùm praedicant hos habere, quod in eos creditur nonniſi baptiſmate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferendum.
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:57387:18"/>Thoſe, who hold they</hi> (the children) <hi>may be ſaved without being regenerated, ſeeme to me, to take away Baptiſm it ſelf, teaching that they haue without it, what we beleiue is not giuen but by Baptiſm.</hi> Thus he; which words are cited by S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> l. 2. cont duas Ep. Pelag. c. 4. ſo what explicates one will ſerue the other, both ſaying the ſame thing.</p>
                     <p>Where it is certain, that he thinks a Participation of the Body &amp; Bloud of Chriſt neceſſary to ſalvation. Now whether he meanes a real, &amp; ſacramental Participation, by receiving the Sacrament; or only a myſtical, or ſpiritual Participation, which both you &amp; we beleiue is attained by the Sacrament of <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> &amp; is the conſtant doctrine of the <hi>Church</hi> to this day, ſeemes not ſo evident. You ſay he meanes the firſt; I ſay, the ſecond, &amp; this is my reaſon: He doth not ſpeake of the participation by <hi>Communion,</hi> or the <hi>Euchariſt;</hi> but of that by <hi>Baptiſm:</hi> for he doth not ſay: <hi>Cum Baptiſmate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferendum,</hi> as if ſome thing different from <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> &amp; adminiſtred with it, were the medium of that Participation; but <hi>Baptiſmate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferendum,</hi> as if <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> were the ſole cauſe or meanes, of that Participation. Now the participation of Chriſt's body by <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> is myſtical, &amp; not ſacramental. Therefore he ſpeakes of the myſtical Participation of Chriſt's Body, &amp; averres that to be neceſſary to ſalvation. Which both you, &amp; I; both <hi>Proteſtants</hi> &amp; <hi>Papiſts</hi> do ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit for tru, &amp; <hi>Catholick doctrine.</hi> How can you then hence inferre, that the <hi>Church hath erred, &amp; may erre?</hi> This is my firſt anſwer.</p>
                     <p>A ſecond is, that he &amp; S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſpeake of participation of the Body &amp; Bloud of Chriſt, <hi>In voto, in deſire,</hi> which all haue, &amp; are bound to haue, when they are baptized . . . . A third is, that in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of Faith, or doctrinal, we make a great difference betwixt what is <hi>Ex profeſſo,</hi> &amp; directly treated, diſcuſſed, &amp; defined, &amp; ſuch other things, as are only accidentally mentioned. Infallibility in the later points, is by vs eſteemed a Priviledge reſerved to the writers of Holy ſcripture, &amp; not pretended to even by general councils: we make likewiſe a great difference betwixt a decree, &amp;
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:57387:19"/>a reaſon for making the decree, &amp; on which it is grounded. For example: in the 7. general Council, it is ſaid, that Angels may be painted, becauſe they haue bodys. We think our ſelves oblid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to beleiue Angels may be painted: but not that they haue Bodys: for our Divines commonly teach the contrary. Now to your ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, J anſwer, that <hi>Innocent</hi> mentions only accidentally that point of Infants Communion, &amp; intends by it, only to proue that <hi>Baptiſm</hi> is neceſſary to ſalvation. So the real Communion is not held by vs, a decree of <hi>Faith.</hi>

                        <hi>Reviſor.</hi> all the ſubſtance of what J will here ſay is contained in this ſyllongiſme: <hi>None out of the true Church of</hi> Chriſt &amp; a ſchiſmatick, <hi>can be ſaved. The</hi> Proteſtants <hi>are out of the tru</hi> Church <hi>of</hi> Chriſt or ſchiſmaticks. <hi>Therefore they cannot be ſaved.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The firſt Propoſition or <hi>Major,</hi> that <hi>none can be ſaved out of the tru</hi> Church <hi>of</hi> Chriſt, is ſo cleere in ſcripture, in Fathers, &amp; even in <hi>Hereticks</hi> themſelues, that all muſt ſee it, who do not wilfully shut their eyes. My firſt Proofe, the Church is the Body of <hi>Christ.</hi> Colos. 1.24. <hi>For his</hi> (Chriſt's) <hi>Body which is the Church.</hi> Vpon which words S. Auſtin diſcourſes thus 1. lib. <hi>Cont. Epistolam Petiliani Donat.</hi> c. 2. <hi>Vnde manifeſtum eſt eum, qui non eſt in membris Chriſti, Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anam ſalutem habere non poſſe. Membra vero Chriſti per vnitatis chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatem ſibi copulantur, &amp; per candem capiti ſuo cohaerent, quod eſt Chriſtus Ieſus. Hence it is evident, that who is not part of Chriſt's body cannot attain to Chriſtian ſalvation. And thoſe are in Chriſts body, who are linked together, &amp; to their head with the loue of vnion.</hi> And in his 19. Chapter. <hi>Ad ſalutem, &amp; vitam aeternam nemo pervenit, niſi qui habet caput Christum. Habere autem caput Chriſtum nemo poterit, niſi qui in eius corpore fuerit, quod eſt Eccleſia. No man can be ſaved, vnleſſe Chriſt be his Head. But Chriſt can be head to no man, who is out of his Body, which is the Church.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>My 2. proofe Rom. 8.9. <hi>If any man haue not the ſpirit of Chriſt, he is none of his.</hi> S. Auſtin alluding to theſe words, tract. 27. in Ioan ſays: <hi>Chriſti ſpiritus neminem animat, qui non ſit de corpore eius. Christs ſpirit doth quicken none but ſuch as are in his Body</hi> that is in the Church.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Proofe: It ſeemes the expreſs words of Chriſt Ioan. 15.6. <hi>If a man abide not in me, he is caſt forth as a branch, &amp; is withered, &amp; men gather them, &amp; cast them into the fire, &amp; they are burnt.</hi> This is the doom of ſuch as abandon Chriſt's Body, which is the <hi>Church,</hi> according to the expreſſe words of the Apoſtle Colos. 1.24.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Proofe out of Fathers. S. <hi>Austin,</hi> l. 4. de Bapt. cont. Donat. C. 1. having ſayd, that the rivers which riſſe in Paradiſe watred

                        <hi>Meſopotamia</hi> &amp; <hi>Aegipt,</hi> thô theſe countryes were not partakers of the happineſſe of Paradiſe: ſo <hi>Baptiſm</hi> may be had out of the <hi>Church;</hi> yet could not conveigh eternal Blis but to thoſe who are within <hi>It,</hi> which hath received the keys to bind, &amp; looſe. And lib. cont. Fauſtum manich. 12.

                     </p>
                     <p>S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> hath a long treatiſe againſt <hi>Schiſmaticks.</hi> In it he ſays, they are the work of the devil, who finding his Temples abandoned, his Altars overturned, his ſacrifices contemned, his rites ſlyghted, &amp; his kingdom deſtroyed by the converſion of the world to <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity,</hi> with deſign to recover his intereſt on Earth, introduced <hi>Schiſmes,</hi> &amp; multiplyed <hi>Schiſmaticks.</hi> And what opinion he S. <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian</hi> had of them take in theſe words: <hi>Can he retain his Faith, who dos not retain the Communion of the Church? &amp; can any man hope to be in the Church, who reſiſts it? who abandons the Chair of Peter, vpon which the Church is built? whoſoever leaving the Church, cleanes to the Harlot, forgoes all promiſes made to the Church, he becomes a ſtranger, a prophane man, &amp; an enemy. God is not a Father to him, who ownes not the Church his mother.</hi> And he aſſures that nether Faith, nor working of miracles, nor knowledg of myſteryes, not martyrdom it ſelf, can entitle a man to eternal life, who dyes in a <hi>Schiſm,</hi> that is out of the Communion of the <hi>Church.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To be short, ſee what the Fathers ſay ſeverally againſt the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>letians,</hi> the <hi>Quarto decimans,</hi> the <hi>Novatians,</hi> the <hi>Donatiſts,</hi> &amp; others. With what fervour they plead the neceſſity of Communion with the <hi>Church:</hi> &amp; with what horror they reject the crime of <hi>Schiſm</hi> which ſome think the greateſt of crimes.</p>
                     <p>My 5. proofe is, Remiſſion of ſins is neceſſary to attain Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. That is not to be found but in the <hi>Church.</hi> Wherefore in the Creed, after the Article of the <hi>Holy Catholick Church,</hi> two others
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:57387:20"/>are added: the <hi>Communion of Saints,</hi> &amp; <hi>Remiſſion of Sins,</hi> as being ſequels of, &amp; dependants on that other. Which is <hi>Calvin's</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection.</p>
                     <p>My 6. Proofe is from the Teſtimony of ſuch as were actual Schiſmaticks themſelves. <hi>Calvin</hi> l. 4. Inſtit. C. 1. S. 4. ſays: <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camus ex hoc vno matris Elogio quam vtilis ſit nobis Ecceſiae Communio, imo neceſſaria: quando non alius eſt ad vitam ingreſſus, niſi nos ipſa concipiat in vtero, niſi pariat, niſi nos alat ſuis vberibus, denique ſub custodiâ, &amp; gubernatione nos teneat, donec exuti carne mortali, ſimiles erimus Angelis . . . . Adde quod extra eius gremium nulla ſperanda est peccatorum remiſſio nec vlla ſalus.</hi> The Church is our <hi>Mother: out of which title wee may learne how vſefull, nay how neceſſary is our Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with her: ſeing there is no poſſibility of attaining to life vnleſſe shee conceiues vs in her wombe, brings vs forth, ſuckles vs with her breasts, protect, &amp; defends vs till leaving this mortal life, we become like vnto Angels . . . . Out of her boſome no hopes of Remiſſion of Sins, nor of ſalvation.</hi> Whence he concludes: <hi>Semper exitialis est ab Eccleſiâ diſceſſio. It is always damnable to depart from the Church.</hi> Thus this grand ſower of <hi>Schiſmes,</hi> the greateſt Enemy to Church Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that ever was: whoſe furious ſpirit communicated with his writings hath cauſed more diſcords, Schiſmes, Seditions, Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons &amp; Murthers, than all other ſects together: His followers ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times wanting Power; but never the will to introduce thoſe plagues their ordinary Attendants.</p>
                     <p>How odjous this ſin is, appeares by the induſtry all <hi>Hereticks</hi> vſe, to remoue it from themſelves, &amp; charge it on the <hi>Catholicks:</hi> as knowing it to be of ſo deformed a nature that nothing can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe it: &amp; the ſtain it leaues of ſoo deep a dye, that a floud of Teares cannot wash it out. Thus much to proue the major, or firſt Propoſition I paſſe now to the minor, or ſecond.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That <hi>Proteſtants</hi> are out of the tru Church, the body of Chriſt, &amp; tru <hi>Schiſmaticks</hi> is evident. <hi>Luther,</hi> their <hi>Pratriarck</hi> renounced all Communion with the <hi>Roman Church:</hi> &amp; nether before, nor after
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:57387:21"/>communicated with any <hi>Church,</hi> even <hi>Schiſmatick.</hi> So he ſeparated, when he began to Dogmatize from all <hi>Chriſtians</hi> living, for he had not gotten followers, &amp; conſequently had not framed them into a <hi>Church.</hi> Wherefore if ever any one was a <hi>Schiſmatick,</hi> he was one. Such were likewiſe thoſe who joyned with him in that ſinfull ſeparation. And he, and they continued ſuch, till their dying day, even when framed into a Congregation: for <hi>Non firmatur tractu temporis, quod ab initio de jure non ſubſiſtit Reg. Iuris.</hi> Proceſſe of time cannot make an Action legal, which from the beginning is contrary to law. Perſeverance in ſin is a circumſtance, which aggravates it: &amp; it is a Paradox to ſay, that a hainous crime should ceaſe to be ſuch, for being long continued: as if the devil could become a ſaint, by being obſtinate in his wickedneſs. A new way to ſanctity, vnknown to ancients. So my minor is vndeniable.</p>
                     <p>So then the firſt <hi>Proteſtant</hi> made a tru <hi>Schiſm:</hi> thoſe, who joined in Communion with him, joined in a tru <hi>Schiſme:</hi> &amp; thoſe, who continu in it, are in a tru <hi>Schiſme,</hi> &amp; tru <hi>Schiſmaticks.</hi> So <hi>The guilt of Schiſme,</hi> (a ſin of the firſt magnitude) <hi>lyes at the Proteſtanes doore: they are</hi> [Say Papiſts] <hi>If they liue &amp; dye Protestants, with out hopes of ſalvation, as living &amp; dying in a greivous mortal ſin.</hi> Which is the concluſion of that ſyllogiſme.</p>
                     <p>You ſay 1. that we forced you vpon the Separation by impoſing vpon our Communion vnlawfull conditions. Which is <hi>Gratis dictum,</hi> ſayd without any ſufficient proofe: for no one point of our faith was ever proved falſe by you, we having much ſtronger grounds, for, than you again it. So the moſt you can draw from your rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons is that our doctrine is not abſolutely certain: whereas nothing can excuſe your <hi>Schiſme,</hi> but an abſolute total certainty, that the thing is naught, which we enjoine. v. c. <hi>Prayers to Saints:</hi> becauſe you ran in to <hi>Schiſme,</hi> to avoyd a thing, which you know not certainly whether it be good, or bad. Nay you haue much greater reaſon to judge good, than otherwiſe, 1. for the authority of the paſt, &amp; preſent Church practiſing it: &amp; 2. becauſe you rather
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:57387:21"/>reproach vs with indiſcreet ſpeeches of pious men, or ſome pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of ſilly women, then with the doctrine of the <hi>Church,</hi> defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in our Councils. Which shews you haue little to ſay againſt our Church doctrine, which is the only thing we enjoin. So you are inexcuſable.</p>
                     <p>Indeed theſe reproaches of errours are not the cauſe; but the effect of your ſeparation. For out of loue to dear lyberty, you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to renounce all ſubjection to Chriſt's vicar vpon earth: then to ſecure this, you reſolved to ſeparate from his Communion by a <hi>Schiſme;</hi> to juſtify this <hi>Schiſme,</hi> theſe pretexts were invented. And by a juſt judgment of God the diſobedient children of your <hi>Church,</hi> haue meeted you the ſame meſure &amp; framed in your boſome another <hi>Schiſme</hi> on the ſame pretences.</p>
                     <p>You ſay 2. Our excommunicating you was the cauſe of the <hi>Schiſme:</hi> ſo the cauſal Schiſme is on our ſide. But this is far from ſatisfiying any thinking man, who calls to mind, that you had forced the excommunication by precedent &amp; juſtifyed it by ſubſequent crimes. Before any ſentence was pronounced againſt you, you had broke the interiour Communion with the <hi>Church,</hi> by altering Faith, &amp; the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriour Communion, by renouncing obedience to the Head of the <hi>Church;</hi> ſo the <hi>Excommunication</hi> was ſubſequent to the <hi>Schiſme:</hi> &amp; what did the Reformation begun before, but perfected after that clap of thunder? Erection of one Altar againſt another, or rather deſtruction of all Altars: profanation of Churchs, robbery of all ſacred veſſels, &amp; ornaments, purſuing with fire &amp; ſword theſe who for conſcience ſake remained in the <hi>Catholick Communion.</hi> Now what hopes of ſalvation left? None vnleſſe Schiſm, ſacriledge, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine, CALVMNY, PERIVRY, MVRTHER, &amp; Hereſy, be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial ſins, &amp; though vnrepented, leaue hopes of ſalvation? For the guilt of all theſe, &amp; many more ye haue contracted, ſince your ſeparation from the center of Eccleſiaſtical Communion. So your debt contracted by the ſeparation is great: but your following de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanour hath enflamed your reckoning to a prodigious ſumme, not
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:57387:22"/>to be diſcharged with any ordinary ſatisfaction: &amp; which is yet encreaſed by a pretence to jnnocency, &amp; a reſolution to juſtify all theſe crying ſins.</p>
                     <p>I acknowledge with S. <hi>Auſtin l.</hi> 6. <hi>de verâ Relig.</hi> C. 6. that ſome jnnocent perſons by Eccleſiaſtical cenſures may be caſt out of the exteriour Communion of the <hi>Church:</hi> that <hi>De facto,</hi> this hath hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to ſome: that ſuch Perſons interiourly retaine the Communion with the faithfull provided they containe themſelves <hi>Intra limites inculpatae tutelae,</hi> do nothing vnlawfull, beare their croſſe patiently, invent no errours, practice nothing for revenge, attempt not to break open the <hi>Church</hi> dores, to force a readmittance, nor barre them vp, to hinder it: do not endeavour to withdraw others from the <hi>Church,</hi> to encreaſe the number of ſeparatiſts, &amp; make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves conſiderable, by becoming heads of a Party. Giue me ſuch a man, &amp; thô he ſeeme to liue, &amp; dye in a <hi>Schiſme,</hi> J shall hope for his ſalvation, with S. <hi>Auſtin.</hi> Whoſe words are theſe: <hi>Sinit diuina providentia per nonnullas nimium turbulentas carnalium hominum ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditiones, expelli de Congregatione Chriſtianâ etiam bonos viros, quam contumeliam, vel iniuriam ſuam, cum patientiſſimè pro Eccleſiae pace tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerint, neque vllas novitates vel ſchiſmatis, vel haereſis moliti fuerint: docebunt homines quam vero affectu &amp; quantâ ſinceritate charitatis Deo ſerviendum ſit. Talium ergo virorum propoſitum eſt, aut ſedatis remeare turbinibus, aut ſi id non ſinantur, vel câdem tempeſtate perſeverante, vel ne de ſuo reditu talis, aut gravior oriatur, tenent voluntatem con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulendi etiam ijs ipſis, quorum motibus, perturbationibuſque ceſſerunt, ſine vllâ conventiculorum ſegregatione, vſque ad mortem defendentes, &amp; teſtimomio iuvantes eam Fidem, quam in Eccleſiâ Catholicâ praedicari ſciunt. Hos coronat in occulto Pater, in occulto videns.</hi> Thus S. <hi>Austin: divine providence ſome times permits</hi> that even <hi>good men are by turbulent ſpirits caſt out of the Church: who if they beare patiently this diſgrace, &amp; wrong, for the Peace of the Church, without endeavouring to frame a Shiſme, or broach Hereſyes, they will by their example teach men, with what ſincere charity they ought to ſerue God. Such men intend ether to
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:57387:22"/>return to the Church, when the ſtorme is blown over, or if they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not return, ether becauſe the ſtormes ceaſes not, or to prevent another ſtorm continue quietly, without gathering conventicles, defending to their Power that Faith, which they know is taught in the Church. Such as theſe are crowned in ſecret, by the Father, who ſeeth in ſecret.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>How many are there of your Party, who haue thus peaceably demeaned themſelves? I meane of the more conſpicuous &amp; gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, or leading part?</p>
                     <q>
                        <l>Vix totidem, quot</l>
                        <l>Thebarum Portae vel divitis oſtia nili.</l>
                     </q>
                     <p>Scarce as many, as the <hi>Muſes,</hi> or even the <hi>Graces.</hi> Soe the number, that on this ſcore can pretend to ſalvation, is very inconſiderable. For the reſt, how different is their proceeding from the others, of whom S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> hopes well? theſe beare the wrong done to them patiently for the loue of peace of the Church, you by tongue &amp; pen, &amp; hands shew your Paſſion. Theſe introduces no noveltys, &amp; cauſe no Schiſmes, or Hereſyes; you do the contrary. Theſe deſire, to return to the Church, the ſtorme being over; you raiſe new ſtor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, &amp; endeavour to perpetuate the ſeparation. Theſe defend the Faith preacht in the Church; you impugn it. Thoſe loue Peace; you hate it, &amp; perſecute all promoters of it. Theſe are guilty of no crime, which may deſerue the Churchs cenſure; you haue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked the Heads of the Church, to inflict on you ſuch a punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Theſe are ready to vndergo any Penalty, without deſerving it, you deſerue it, &amp; will vndergo none. Jn fine theſe are jnnocent; you guilty, &amp; guilty of a great crime, &amp; aggravate it, by glorying in it, <hi>Peccatum ſuum ſicut Sodoma praedicaverunt.</hi> So we muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that their example ſerves not to juſtify, but to condemne you, who differ ſo much from them, &amp; therefore thô we grant with that great ſaint, that <hi>There is life in the way of theſe; yet your way leads to Death.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. Wherefore it is both an <hi>Vſual ſaying,</hi> &amp; a <hi>Setled judgment</hi> of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks,</hi> that <hi>Proteſtants</hi> remaining ſuch, cannot be ſaved. Becauſe that name imports two greivous ſins: <hi>Schiſme,</hi> by ſeparation from
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:57387:23"/>the Communion of the <hi>Church,</hi> &amp; <hi>Heresy,</hi> by beleiving errours contrary to <hi>Faith.</hi> Which two ſins taken ſeverally, or together; make vs deſpayr of their ſalvation.</p>
                     <p>You pretend, <hi>Proteſtants</hi> will ſay the like of <hi>Papiſts.</hi> I reply, it may be ſo: but haue they ſuch ſtrong grounds, for that ſaying, as <hi>Catholicks</hi> haue. Jn 1642. the Factious part of the Parliament did vie with the loyal &amp; peaceable party in verbal expreſſions of Duty &amp; Allegiance to their ſoverain. But on the one ſide were only words; &amp; reality on the other: &amp; it was J think not neceſſary, to caſt a figure, to diſcerne which ſide only pretended Allegiance; but intended the contrary. And it is as viſible, whether ſide in Religion aimes at Peace, &amp; maintaines the ancient Faith, &amp; which inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vates, the wordes of both partys being vncyp hered by their acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the beſt interpreters of them.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore F. <hi>Darcy's</hi> argument remaines in force, that it is ſafer to joine with the <hi>Catholicks,</hi> than with the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> (as it was ſafer to avoyd Treaſon, to joine with the king, than with the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament) there being no ſin in remaining in the Communion of the <hi>Catholick Church:</hi> &amp; two great ſins, <hi>Schiſm,</hi> &amp; <hi>Hereſy,</hi> in joining with the <hi>Proteſtants.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>You ſay, that this Reaſon would proue, that in S. <hi>Auſtin's</hi> time it was ſafer to joine with the <hi>Donatiſts,</hi> than with the <hi>Catholicks,</hi> ſeing both ſides agreed that the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> could be ſaved; &amp; the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natiſts</hi> denyed that poſſibility to the <hi>Catholicks.</hi> Anſwer: you are here groſſely miſtaken [pardon that word] for S. <hi>Austin</hi> never ſayd a <hi>Donatiſt</hi> remaining ſuch <hi>Could be ſaved;</hi> nay a great part of his workes againſt them is employed to proue, that they cannot be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that their <hi>Baptiſm</hi> avayles them nothing, but ſerues for their greater damnation. Let me beſeech you, only to open any leafe, any page, of the ſeveral bookes written againſt them, there is none, which will not correct that miſtake. What you should ſay is, only, that both ſides owned tru <hi>Baptiſm</hi> amongſt the <hi>Donatiſts;</hi> which theſe denyed amongſt <hi>Catholicks.</hi> Which argument the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natiſts</hi>
                        <pb n="33" facs="tcp:57387:23"/>not only myght; but did make vſe of, to pervert <hi>Catholicks,</hi> as you may ſee in S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> L. 1. <hi>de Bapt. cont. Donat.</hi> c. 3. &amp; l. 2. <hi>cont. Petilianum,</hi> c. 108. &amp; elſe where.</p>
                     <p>To this I anſwer, that ſuch a reaſon from a <hi>Donatiſt</hi> to a <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick</hi> is of no force, he having no good ground at all for that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to rely on, &amp; therefore denying <hi>Baptiſme</hi> in the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> only out of a peevishneſſe of nature, &amp; Religion: &amp; it was by them ſayd with no more cauſe, than <hi>Quakers</hi> had to ſay: <hi>Thou art dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,</hi> when they had nothing elſe to ſay. Where as <hi>Catholicks</hi> proue that Aſſertion of theirs with jrrefragable reaſon, drawn from thoſe two crying ſins, <hi>Schiſme,</hi> &amp; <hi>Hereſy,</hi> of which we accuſe the <hi>Proteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants,</hi> &amp; theſe do not, nay cannot ſufficiently cleere. I haue all ready explicated theſe reaſons. That thoſe of the <hi>Donatists</hi> were frivolous, is evident, for they ſayd: ſome Bishops of the <hi>Catholick Communion</hi> were <hi>Traditores,</hi> had delivered the ſacred bookes to the Perſecutors, &amp; that all <hi>Catholicks</hi> by communicating with them, did contract the ſame guilt, &amp; had loſt the <hi>Holy Ghoſt.</hi> And hence they inferred, there could be no valid <hi>Baptiſme</hi> in the <hi>Catholick Communion:</hi> for thoſe who haue not the Holy Ghoſt, cannot give him to others.</p>
                     <p>To which the <hi>Catholicks</hi> anſwered, 1. that thoſe Bishops accuſed of that shamefull compliance with the jmperial Edicts againſt <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> were jnnocent of that crime, which was never ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently proved vpon them: &amp; no man ought to be condemned vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe the crime be evidently proved againſt him.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. They anſwered, that althô the perſons accuſed were really guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, yet their perſonal guilt could not prejudice all <hi>Catholicks</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating with them: becauſe another man's ſin cannot prejudice me, vnleſſe J make it my own by commanding, or perſwading, approving, defending, or imitating it. Now the <hi>Catholicks</hi> were ſo far from being acceſſory to that pretended ſin in another, that they deteſted the ſin, &amp; always condemned it, in all perſons, who were really guilty of it: but never could find ſufficient grounds to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce thoſe accuſed by the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> guilty of it, as thoſe would haue them doe.</p>
                     <pb n="34" facs="tcp:57387:24"/>
                     <p>They anſwered 3. that ſuppoſing (not granting) that the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons accuſed were really guilty, &amp; that guilt had infected the whole body of <hi>Catholicks,</hi> by communicating with them: yet their <hi>Baptiſm</hi> myght be valid, this not depending on the Perſonal ſanctity of its Miniſter, but on the juſtitution, &amp; promiſes of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> &amp; the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt.</hi> Hence S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſayd he did not regard <hi>Peter</hi> when he Baptizes, nor <hi>Paul,</hi> nor <hi>Iohn,</hi> nor <hi>Iudas;</hi> but he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> who is the <hi>Baptiſt,</hi> who ever he be who was<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hes the body, &amp; pronounces the words, as Miniſter of that Sacrament.</p>
                     <p>You ſe how frivolous the reaſons of the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> were, to deny the validity of <hi>Baptiſm</hi> in the <hi>Catholick Church.</hi> Shew that ours are as frivolous, &amp; J will grant the parity: but this you can never doe. So our Reaſon ſtands good againſt you; that of the <hi>Donatists</hi> againſt vs falls to the ground.</p>
                     <p>It ſeemes not diſcreet in an <hi>English Proteſtant</hi> to mention the <hi>Donatiſts,</hi> there being ſo great a reſemblance betwixt theſe two ſchiſmatical Churchs, that they may ſeem ſiſters, &amp; the later to haue copyed the other: which appeares by theſe paralel points.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>Donatiſts</hi> were no where out of one corner of the world, <hi>Africa:</hi> &amp; <hi>Proteſtants</hi> of the Church of Eng. [that is ſuch as agree with her in points of Doctrine, &amp; <hi>Hierarchy</hi>] no where out of England.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Donatiſts</hi> ſayd theirs was the only perfect, vnſpotted Church; you ſay yours is the only Apoſtolical Church, perfectly reformed &amp;c.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Thoſe endeavoured to juſtify their ſeparation with ſome pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended faults of particular men: you to juſtify yours alleadg ſome indiſcreet devotions of old women, and vnwary words of ſome (otherwiſe) pious Authours.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Thoſe appealed to ſome parts of ſcripture, which you vſe againſt vs; And the Fathers proved againſt them the <hi>Vniverſality of the Church,</hi> &amp; the <hi>neceſſity of Communion with her,</hi> out of the ſame texts, which we vſe againſt you.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. <hi>Donatiſts</hi> called <hi>Rome</hi> the ſeat, or Chair of peſtilence; you call it a <hi>Peſt-houſe,</hi> [letter to her R. H. P. 17.] &amp; the ſeat of <hi>Antichriſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <pb n="35" facs="tcp:57387:24"/>
                     <p n="6">6. Thoſe had their <hi>Circumcellions,</hi> who thought to do God good ſervice, in murthering <hi>Catholicks:</hi> you haue ſome of the ſame per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion, as appeares by their workes. Yet I own a great difference betwixt the old <hi>Circumcellions,</hi> &amp; the new ones: Thoſe, when the toy took them, would ether break their own necks, or force others to cut their throates; &amp; the new ones in this do not imitate them, they loue too much their mothers ſons.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. Thoſe had the <hi>Maximianiſts,</hi> who left them for the ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, they had broken off Communion with the <hi>Church,</hi> theſe haue the <hi>Presbiterians,</hi> &amp; others, who will not conforme with them vpon the ſame grounds, for which they refuſe to conform to the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="8">8. And laſtly: the <hi>Non-conformist donatists</hi> made evident to the world, that the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> had no real ground to break the <hi>Catholick Communion,</hi> by forcing them to ſolue their owne Objections againſt the <hi>Church,</hi> [of which S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> l. 2. Retract. C. 35.] And your <hi>Non conformiſts</hi> with the ſame ſucceſſe force you to anſwer all your pretences againſt vs, &amp; breake thoſe weapons, with which you haue hitherto fought againſt the Church.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe who will take the paines to examin further the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> principles, will diſcover more points of agreement betwixt them, &amp; you. Theſe are ſufficient to shew, that what is now hath been before, &amp; will be: &amp; that as the <hi>Church</hi> ſticks conſtantly through all ages to the ſame <hi>Faith,</hi> &amp; ways of defending it; ſo Factious ſpirits, &amp; ſeditious Brethren break her <hi>Communion,</hi> turn <hi>Schiſmaticks,</hi> broach <hi>Hereſyes,</hi> &amp; impugn her, &amp; defend themſelves, with the ſame principles.</p>
                     <p>I am now arrived at the end of this real, or pretended <hi>Conference,</hi> without omitting any one material point of it. I hope I haue given reaſonable ſatisfaction; of which others will judge more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partially, then my ſelfe, if I am miſtaken, by judging too favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably of my owne labours, &amp; my replyes be found vnſatisfactory, J deſire that defect be charged on my weakeneſſe; not on the cauſe,

I expect shortly to ſee ſome other appeal to <hi>Beaſts</hi> ſeing many of
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:57387:25"/>the better ſort of theſe ſurpaſſe man, as to quickneſſe of <hi>Senſes,</hi> which in them are much more perfect, then in moſt, if not al men: &amp; therefore may be ſayd to be more competent judges of the objects of <hi>Senſes,</hi> then men can be. Indeed <hi>Seducers proficiunt in peius,</hi> wax worſe, &amp; worſe, 2. Tim. 2.13. &amp; it is not ſo great a ſtep from the <hi>Senſes of men,</hi> to thoſe of <hi>Beaſts,</hi> (which are of the ſame <hi>Species,</hi> &amp; are rather more, than leſſe perfect in their kind J as it is from the <hi>Church directed by the Holy Ghoſt, for our jnſtruction in Faith,</hi> to <hi>Carnal ſenſes:</hi> That having ſomething of divine, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Holy Ghoſt aſſiſting; theſe being meere <hi>Corporal,</hi> &amp; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low all that hath any thing of Reaſon. A fit judge indeed for ſuch a <hi>Church,</hi> as the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> is!</p>
                     <p>My horrour changed into <hi>Indignation,</hi> when I heard the <hi>Verdict</hi> brought in by this <hi>Iury,</hi> the <hi>Sentence</hi> pronounced by this <hi>Vmpire,</hi> this <hi>Brutish judge</hi> [yet from ſuch a <hi>Iudg</hi> little leſſe could be hoped for, in ſuch a matter] by which, the <hi>Scripture</hi> is ſilenced, <hi>Tradition</hi> trampled vnder foot, <hi>Fathers</hi> rejected, the <hi>Practice</hi> &amp; <hi>Faith</hi> of the whole <hi>Catholick Church</hi> condemned, the <hi>Communion</hi> with all Faith full, all the Catholick Church renounced, &amp; a horrid &amp; exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crable <hi>Schiſme</hi> authorized, And all this vpon the depoſition of ſo vile a witneſſe, &amp; by the <hi>Sentence</hi> of ſo contemptible a judg, as <hi>Carnal ſenſe.</hi> And this <hi>Sentence</hi> accepted of, recommended by a le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arned Doctor of divinity, &amp; a pretended <hi>Ryght Reverend Bishop.</hi> Is <hi>Christianity,</hi> is <hi>Divine Faith</hi> brought to this?</p>
                     <p>Yet J find one ſign of <hi>Modeſty</hi> (vnleſſe it were rather <hi>Cunning,</hi> &amp; craftineſſe in adorning the ſtage for this piece of Pageantry, &amp; diſpoſing for this extravagant judgment) that there is ether no mention at all, of the grounds of <hi>Catholick Faith</hi> in this treatiſe: or elſe it is ſo ſilent, &amp; low a mention, that it is ſcarce perceptible. For had you ſet before the eyes of your Readers, the practice of the <hi>Church,</hi> the Teſtimonys of Fathers, the decrees of councils, the written, &amp; vnwritten word of God, in fine the vnanimous vote of the primitiue &amp; preſent <hi>Church,</hi> averring that to be <hi>Chriſts Body

For if we <hi>Muſt pull out our eye if it ſcandalize vs:</hi> we muſt shut our eyes, ſtop our cares, renounce all our <hi>Senſes,</hi> when thy contradict God's expreſſe word.

Are not our <hi>Senſes</hi> the ſame now, as they were a thouſand or ſixteen hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred yeares ago? Are their objects changed?

<pb n="39" facs="tcp:57387:26"/>
                        <hi>Althô it ſeemes to be Bread, yet it is not Bread: Althô it ſeemes to be wine, yet it is not wine.</hi> Thus this great ſaint, &amp; ancient Father, delivering Chriſtian Doctrine in a Catechiſme. So this is not his private ſentiment; but that of the Church, not things of his own invention; but of publick Tradition. Till then <hi>Chriſtians</hi> retained a ſincere, &amp; entire veneration for the word of God; they harkned indeed to <hi>Senſes;</hi> but more to God: &amp; when theſe two interfered, one ſaying <hi>That is Chriſt's Body,</hi> the other it is not ſuch, <hi>It is Bread,</hi> they did not heſitate which to follow, they eaſily reſolved, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced in favour of Faith, &amp; ſubſcribed to the ſon of God, <hi>Who had words of life, even life everlasting.</hi> Io. 6.69.</p>

                        <hi>Animalis homo non percivit ca quae ſunt ſpiritus Dei, &amp;c.</hi> ſays the Apoſtle, 1.

Is it not of <hi>Faith</hi> [or revealed Truth preached by the Apoſtle] that he ſpeakes in that place? Now if Faith be aboue the reach of the whole <hi>Natural man,</hi> how comes it to be below <hi>Senſes,</hi> which are his loweſt facultyes? Juſt as if what the Apoſtle ſays is over my head, you should ſay is vnder my feet. But why doth not the <hi>Natural man receiue</hi> Faith? Becauſe <hi>It is foolishneſſe vnto him.</hi> And juſt ſuch is <hi>Tranſubstantiation</hi> to you, &amp; therefore is laught at by you, the other reaſon is convincing: <hi>He cannot receiue</hi> Faith, <hi>Becaus it is ſpiritually diſcerned.</hi> Are <hi>Senſes</hi> ſpiritual facultyes? can they <hi>Spiritually diſcern?</hi> If not [as certainly they cannot] pull them off the throne, on which you placed them, of which they are vnworthy as being vncapable of diſcerning the thing in queſtion, which is of <hi>The ſpirit of God, ſpiritual,</hi> &amp; <hi>diſcerned only ſpiritually.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>No leſſe; but rather more evident are the words of the ſame Apoſtle, 2. Cor. 10.4. <hi>The weapons of our warfare,</hi> ſays he, <hi>are not carnal; but myghty through God, to the pulling down of strong holds; casting down imaginations, &amp; every hygh thing, that exalteth it ſelfe
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:57387:27"/>againſt the knowledge of God: &amp; bringing into captivity every Thought to the obedience of Chriſt . . . . do ye look on things after the outward appearance?</hi> Thus your own Tranſlation Which words decide the thing in queſtion: For firſt it is evident he ſpeakes of the Doctrine he preacht, which is <hi>Faith.</hi> And in the firſt place he cleerely diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cards outward <hi>Senſes</hi> from any share in this judgment? <hi>The wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons of our warfare are not carnal:</hi> now <hi>Senſes</hi> are <hi>Carnal,</hi> as is cleere.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. He rejects inward <hi>Senſes: Casting down all jmaginations.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>Thus according to the Apoſtle, all facultys of ſoul &amp; body, ſpiritual, &amp; carnal, interiour, &amp; exteriour, muſt vayle bonnet to Faith, which is termed <hi>Myghty through God.</hi> The laſt queſtion, <hi>Do ye look on things according to their out ward appearance?</hi> Is a conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the foregoing diſcourſe, &amp; cuts all the nerves of the Doctors argument. Which is totally grounded <hi>Vpon out ward appearance to carnal ſenſe.</hi> Let vs apply the Apoſtles meaning to our preſent pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, by ſome few queſtions.</p>
                     <p>What will you ſay that is, on the Holy Altar M<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> Dr? Anſwer: Bread &amp; wine. But why do you think it to be bread &amp; wine? An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer: wee <hi>looke on the out ward appearance,</hi> &amp; <hi>judge of the thing after that.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>You know, ſir, that the <hi>Catholick Church</hi> all over the wor'd, even <hi>Luther</hi> himſelf, beleived it to be the Body &amp; Bloud of <hi>Christ:</hi> with what weapons do you combat their opinion?

                     <p>Now let vs propoſe ſuch queſtions to a Catholick. What do you beleiue that to be, which is on the Altar? Anſwer: the tru Body &amp; Bloud of Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>But why do you beleiue it to be the Body &amp; Bloud of Chriſt? Anſwer: Becauſe Chriſt ſays it is ſo: &amp; the Church teaches me, his words are ſo to be vnderſtood.</p>
                     <p>Doth it appear to be the Body &amp; Bloud of Chriſt? Anſwer: no. But <hi>We look not on things after the out ward appearance,</hi> when that
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:57387:27"/>is not conformable to the word of God, delivered to vs by the Church.</p>
                     <p>With what weapons do you combat the contrary errour? Anſwer: <hi>The weapons</hi> we vſe <hi>Are not carnal</hi> ſenſe; <hi>But myghty through God, to deſtroy all jmaginations, &amp; beate downe all thoughts</hi> which are rayſed in vs in oppoſition to the divine, &amp; revealed truth.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. If we conſult Reaſon in this debate, we shall ſee, that <hi>Senſes</hi> ought not to be admitted as judges, it being abſolutely impoſſible, they should vnderſtand the matter in queſtion: &amp; therefore cannot poſſibly pronounce ſentence, on ether ſide. For what is the queſtion? What is the meaning of thoſe words: of our Bleſſed ſaviour: <hi>This is my Body: this is my Bloud:</hi> for I ſuppoſe your jmpiety is not ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived to that heygth, as to deny his words to be tru: or ſay, you would not beleiue any thing to be, what he plainly, &amp; vndeniably ſays it is. That is, you do not beleiue that God doth, or can tell a <hi>Lye.</hi> Otherwiſe farewell all Faith: &amp; we muſt make vſe of other <hi>Mediums</hi> to deale with you. Our diſpute then being about the ſenſe of thoſe words of Chriſt, J proue, that our ſenſes cannot judg in it, with this argument.</p>
                     <q>
                        <p> 
                           <hi>Senſes</hi> cannot judg of things, which are not their proper objects: But ſuch are the things in debate in this controverſy: Therefore ſenſes cannot judg of theſe things.</p>
                        <p> The major, or firſt Propoſition is cleere. For the eye cannot judg of a found, becauſe it is not its proper object. Nor the eare of a colour for the ſame reaſon. The ſame of all other ſenſes. Wherefore no ſenſe can judg of any thing, that is not its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per object.</p>
                        <p> The minor, or ſecond propoſition, viz, things in debate here are not the proper object of <hi>Senſes,</hi> is alſo ſelfe evident: For the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per meaning, or ſignification of words, is the proper object of no ſenſe. But the matter here in debate, is the proper meaning or ſignification of the words of Chriſt. Therefore it is the proper object of no ſenſe.</p>
                     </q>
                     <p>Theſe Premiſſes are ſo evidently tru, that J think it enough
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:57387:28"/>only to proue the firſt Propoſition: &amp; this I doe by induction, for nether eye, nor noſe, nor palate, nor hand, nor eare can ſee, taſt ſmel, feale, or heare the ſignification of words, wherefore no ſenſe can perceiue it. The only doubt can be about Hearing, by reaſon of the convexion betwixt the ſound of an Articulate word (which is the object of the eare) &amp; the ſignification of it: yet even here my Propoſition is tru: for the ſame articulate ſound is inſignificant to one who vnderſtands it not: &amp; ſometimes ſignifyes different things to perſons of different langages. v. c. <hi>Lego,</hi> to a Latiniſt ſignifyes <hi>I reade:</hi> to a Grecian, I ſpeake: to an English man nothing. Yet the ſound in the eare is the ſame to all theſe three. Jndeed if it were not ſo, by learning anew language, our eares should be changed, &amp; framed in a different manner, to repreſent the new ſignification. Which I ſuppoſe no body will ſay.</p>
                     <p>As to the other Propoſition [the minor] that our diſpute is about the ſignification of thoſe words, is as evident: For our ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent is grounded on the words being taken litterally: yours vpon their being taken figuratively. Both which are the ſeverall ſigni<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fications.</p>
                     <p>One thing only occurres in anſwer to this, viz, that the litteral ſignification is ſo abſurd, that it cannot be admitted. Anſwer: this is ſayd, but not proved: &amp; in du place theſe abſurditys will be confidered, &amp; J hope found to be no bſurditys. Anſwer 2. this doth not ſatisfy my reaſon: for no Abſurdity can make any faculty judg of what it cannot know. As no Abſurdity can make me a competent judg of a compoſition in the Chineſe language, of which J am entirely ignorant.</p>
                     <p>Here I myght lay down my pen, it already appearing, that all you can alleadg from <hi>Senſes</hi> can ſignify nothing, ſeing they cannot depoſe of a thing they are totally ſtrangers to: &amp; you ſay nothing but from <hi>Senſes.</hi> Jt was indeed a great ſigne of a bad cauſe, when you appealed from the proper judges, to thoſe, who are in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent: &amp; there plead as earneſtly, as if you were in earneſt, when
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:57387:28"/>all is only to amuſe your reader, by drawing his Attention, from what myght inſtruct him, to what cannot, as women amuſe children with Rattles. Indeed your diſcourſe, &amp; theſe, are alike ſignificant, as will appeare, by diſcuſſing the particulars. I will before I paſſe to that, enquire further into the nature, &amp; force of ſenſes.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. THat by our <hi>Senſes</hi> we come to the knowledg of ſeveral ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, is an vndoubted Truth. Our vnderſtanding by its Creation receives little or no knowledg at all, if we beleiue Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers: &amp; therefore <hi>Aristotle</hi> compares it to a white Paper, or a cleere cloth to paint on, in which there is nether one letter written, nor one line drawne: the taske of filling vp that Paper, or table, being left to objects, which by the meanes of <hi>Senſes,</hi> as by their Pens, or Penſils, write or delineat their Reſemblances, or Pictures, [which are the knowledges, we haue of them] in our mind.</p>
                     <p>Some think this is as the moſt noble, ſo the moſt neceſſary work of ſenſes, &amp; that which nature, in giving them to vs cheifely, &amp; even onely intended. Others ſay this is onely an accidental, &amp; ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional employment ſcarce intended directly by nature: which in the firſt place deſigned them as ſo many life-guards, or ſentinells, to man, to diſcover, &amp; giue timely notice of Approching objects, &amp; their condition of Freinds, or Foes, good, or bad, hartfull,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:57387:29"/>&amp; diſpleaſant; or pleaſant, &amp; confortable: to the end man myght not be ſurpriſed; but prepared to receiue thoſe favourable, &amp; reject &amp; defend it ſelfe from the reſt. This is the opinion of the french Authour of <hi>The ſearch of Truth,</hi> in the firſt book of that work: in which by many inſtances, &amp; experiences he proues that the <hi>Senſes</hi> are frequently miſtaken, &amp; deceiue vs, when ſoever they ſtretch beyond that duty, of informing man of the advantage, or disad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage he may receiue from an vnexpected, &amp; otherwiſe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne neyghbour: yet it is vndeniable, that they are ſubſervient, &amp; very officious in providing matter for the vnderſtanding to worke vpon, &amp; the ſyght aboue all the reſt. Thoſe who are deſirous of larger prooſes of the deceipts of thoſe ſentinels, &amp; of the falſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmes they giue, may find ſatisfaction in that neate Authour. My deſigne being here no other, than to shew, that the <hi>Senſes</hi> cannot be always relyed on, in the reports they make, it will be ſufficient to proue by ſome few, but cleere, &amp; vndeniable examples, that the <hi>Senſes</hi> ſome, nay many times do miſinforme vs, by repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting things otherwiſe than they are; and (which is cheifely to our purpoſe) ſome times things, which are not.</p>

It is not to my purpoſe to enquire into, &amp; explicate the cauſes of theſe ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, my deſigne not being to write of meere Phyloſophical things, further then is neceſſary to diſcover that the <hi>Senſes,</hi> of <hi>Feeling</hi> doth deceiue vs, by repreſenting a ſubſtance, where there is none: &amp; ſuch is that ſenſation of a Feather tickling, and a foote, or ſome other hard body preſſing vpon ours, althô this it ſelf is no more in being.</p>

                     <p n="3">3. The quickeſt, &amp; leaſt corporal of all our <hi>Senſes</hi> is the ſyght: yet it is obnoxious to many deceipts. The appearances of a medal in abaſin, full of water, which thô at the bottone ſeemes at the top: jtem of an oare, which halfe vnder water ſeemes broken, I omit, as trivial, &amp; ordinary. Our ſyght discouers no diſtance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the top of a hill, or the ridge of a houſe beyond which the moone riſes: nay our eyes repreſent her as touching, or contiguous to them. It repreſents the ſun, &amp; moone as plaine, althô both be ſpherical. It repreſents the dïameter of the moone (&amp; ſun) leſſer when shee is in our meridian, then when she is rïſing aboue, or fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling vnder our <hi>Horiſon:</hi> thô it should appeare greater as being a whole ſemidiameter of the Earth, neerer vs, when in our meridian, then when in the eaſt or weſt, if she moues in a perfect circle.

                     <p>Our eyes in ſublunary things are as vncertaine. Looke from a Bridge ſteedfaſtly on the water, &amp; this shall ſeeme to ſtand, &amp; the other moue. Inaship vnder ſayl, the shore ſeemes to moue; &amp; not the ship: Hence the Poet: <hi>Terraeque Vrbeſque recedunt.</hi>

                     <p>Looke in a ſtreyght line with a Canon bullet, not withſtanding the the vnconceivable ſwiftneſſe of its motion, it will ſeeme to the eye to haue none at all, except a little falling towards the end. Of how many Angels do we reade in ſcriptures, who appeared like men? As <hi>Raphael</hi> to <hi>Tobias, Gabriel,</hi> to <hi>Zacharie,</hi> &amp; the Bleſſed Virgin; others to <hi>Ioſue, Gedeon, Manue,</hi> &amp;c.? What variety of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours in a <hi>Rainbow,</hi> &amp; a Pigeon's neck? Here ſome reflected lyght affects the eye as if it were real colours: &amp; in the other examples, a little condenſed ayre lookes like the real body of a man. Examples of this nature myght be multiplyed without end, were it need full: but theſe are enough to proue, that our eyes are in many things miſtaken, repreſenting things in motion, which ſtir not; &amp; in reſt others, which moue: shewing ſubſtance other then it is, &amp; colours where there are none.</p>
                     <p>As for Hearing, ſome raving haue ſeemed to heare a conſort of muſicke. A perſon of my acquaintance was once awakened with an exceeding great noiſe, as if guns had ben shot off at his bed ſide. Calling to mind, that there was nether Canon, nor any thing elſe, neere, which could cauſe that vaſt noyſe, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded it muſt be ſomething in his eare; &amp; picking it, he pulled out a little inſect, bred in ſome roſes, which the day before he had throwne over the teſter of his bed, which falling from them, &amp; creeping into his eare, with the motion of its little tender feete cauſed that huge noyſe.</p>
                     <p>Whither theſe, &amp; ſuch like inſtances of the vncertainty of our <hi>Senſes,</hi> ſufficiently proue, that they were not deſigned by the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour of nature, God Almyghty, for inſtruments of ſciences, or to conveygh new notions into our mind, or only, as Guards, or ſentinels, for our ſecurity, &amp; preſervation, (the only thing they can be deſigned for in Beaſts, thô theſe haue their <hi>Senſes</hi> as perfect, as men) I leaue to the judgment of others: as alſo to determine,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:57387:30"/>whither theſe examples can ground a judgment in that doubt. what I gather hence, is</p>
                     <p>That <hi>Senſes</hi> are often miſtaken, &amp; that even about their proper objects. That theſe errours are ſometimes corrected by our owne reaſon, or diſcourſe, &amp; ſome times by advice, or information from other men. For example: we know that on oare hath a ſtrong conſiſtency of parts, to which thoſe of the water yeild, as having no conſiſtency at all. Whence thô our eyes repreſent it, as broken in the water, we conclude their depoſition falſe, 1. becauſe water cannot breake a ſtrong oare gently thruſt into it, &amp; 2. becauſe if it were broken by the water, it would not be whole, when taken out, as we ſee it is. Thus reaſon corrects our eyes. By diſcourſe likewiſe we find, that the diameter of the moone is much bigger, then a foote, as our eyes repreſent it. Now an illiterate Bumpkin, who knowes not how the tru quantity of a body ſeemes leſſe, by reaſon of its diſtance from the eye, heares one, whome he beleiues to be a learned clark, ſay, the moone is bigger then all his grounds are, &amp; he beleiues him: &amp; vpon his credit, corrects that errour of his eyes. So he preferres the word of that learned man before his ſyght.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. It is eaſy to draw from theſe premiſſes, the concluſion cheifely intended, viz, that it is rash, &amp; preſumptuous to alleadge, &amp; rely on any ſenſation contrary to the word of God, or any revealed Truth. For if your reaſon, &amp; diſcourſe, or the Authority of a man, more knowing, &amp; experienced then our ſelues are ſufficient to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke vs frame a judgment different from, or contrary to the depoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the moſt perfect of our <hi>Senſes,</hi> our eyes, with much grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter reaſon ought we to ſuſpect their depoſitions, nay &amp; reject them, when we find them diſagree from what God hath atteſted. For J hope the world is not brought as yet by Dogmatizers to ſuch a degree of <hi>Libertiniſme,</hi> &amp; <hi>Atheiſme,</hi> as to ſay, that God either can be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived him ſelfe, through ignorance, or can maliciouſly deceiue vs. And if the credit of a man be ſufficient to reforme the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:57387:31"/>we frame on our ſenſations, shall that of God be leſſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded? Wherefore we muſt nether prefer <hi>Reaſon</hi> before <hi>Faith,</hi> with <hi>Socinus:</hi> nor [which is worſe] <hi>Senſe</hi> before <hi>Faith,</hi> with Dr. <hi>Morley;</hi> but with S. <hi>Paul,</hi> &amp; the Church, ſubmit both <hi>Senſe,</hi> &amp; <hi>Reaſon,</hi> to <hi>Faith:</hi> &amp; let <hi>God be tru, &amp; all men lyars.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And this concluſion holds tru, whither one, or more <hi>Senſes</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the ſame thing, or whither the revealed Truth be confirmed by any <hi>Senſe,</hi> or no: for if a clowne doth prudently prefer the word of one whome he thinks learned, before his ſyght, which no other ſenſe doth, or can correct, it is certainly prudent to prefer the word of God before all <hi>Senſes,</hi> &amp; before our reaſon too.</p>

ALthô I think the <hi>Senſes</hi> ſometimes are, &amp; often may be miſtaken, &amp; for that reaſon think we ought to reject their depoſitions, when they are contrary to ſuch things, as we haue greater reaſon to truſt to: yet J am far from the ſenſeleſſe errour of thoſe, who ſay, no credit at all is du to them: or that by them we cannot be ſufficiently aſſured, that we haue nether hornes, nor a coxcombe on our head, that our noſe is nether the bille of a cocke, nor the trunk of an Elephant: or that our Body is fleſh,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:57387:31"/>&amp; not glaſſe, or butter. Which is the ſentiment of the Authour of the <hi>Search of Truth. Carteſius</hi> teachs vs more, to doubt whither we are awake, or a ſleepe, or haue any body at all. Which doubts, if really admitted, &amp; not pretended only, afford an excellent pretext to all <hi>Ignoramus jurys:</hi> to all malefactours, who may pretend the witneſſes are not certain of what they depoſe: to all Rebells, &amp; Refractory ſubjects, who may alleadge their doubts againſt the King's Proclamation: laſtly to all knaues, who may pretend igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the promiſes, which they haue no mind to keepe. So this <hi>Carteſian</hi> way to knowledge, &amp; certainty, by caſting off all former knowledge, &amp; ſenſes, as vncertain, lays the Axe at the roote of all Authority, diſſolues all bonds of commerce amongſt men, &amp; is only good to make <hi>Scepticks,</hi> &amp; <hi>Atheiſts</hi> too, ſeing it leaues no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain meanes to teach, or learne <hi>Faith,</hi> &amp; to vnderſtand ſcripture, or Councils. So that nether Church, nor ſtate can ſtand, if theſe doubts againſt the depoſitions of <hi>Senſes,</hi> without any ground to the contrary, beſides the general fallibility of our <hi>Senſes</hi> themſelues, be really admitted.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore when D. <hi>Morley</hi> often repeates, that we deny all au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to our <hi>Senſes,</hi> he is either deceived himſelf, or deceiues his reader, which is worſe: for we rely on our <hi>Senſes,</hi> where Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, or greater Authority doth not contradict them: of both which J haue giuen examples. So a man ſees <hi>Titius</hi> kill <hi>Simpronius,</hi> &amp; depoſes it vpon oath: his depoſition ought to be admitted, not<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>withſtanding all <hi>Carteſian</hi> doubts. So <hi>Peter</hi> relyes on a promiſe of <hi>Paul</hi> to Pay him within ſuch a time, 100. l. <hi>Paul</hi> is bound to make it good, &amp; <hi>Peter</hi> may exact it by law.</p>

<pb n="50" facs="tcp:57387:32"/>mind] for they are tru, when conformable to their object: as this <hi>The whole is greater, then any part of it.</hi> They are falſe, when not conformable to them, as this: <hi>Apart of a body is as greate, as the whole.</hi> Some adde a third kind of Propoſitions, indifferent to Truth, &amp; Falshood: but this is only relating to our minds, which are vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain, whither they be tru or falſe. But in themſelues they are determinately either tru or falſe, &amp; it is as certaine they cannot be otherwiſe, as it is certaine, that a thing either is, or is not: it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing impoſſible, that any thing should be, &amp; not be, at the ſame ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me. That is to ſay, two contradictions can nether be tru, nor falſe.</p>
                     <p>This Truth, or conformity of a Propoſition with its object, may be knowne ſeveral ways. 1. by its natiue lyght, &amp; ſelf evidence, of the thoughts themſelues, which when well vnderſtood, evidently appeare the ſame. For example <hi>Two &amp; two are four.</hi> Jtem: <hi>A ſtreyght line is the shortest betwixt two points.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. By diſcourſe: as when by the thoughts themſelues it doth not appeare how they agree, we compare them with a third. Thus by applying a line to two bodyes, &amp; finding it equal to each ſeverally, we conclude they are both of an equall bigneſſe, 3. by ſenſe: as when J ſee a man walke, I know he moues. 4. By report of another: as when a freind tells me, he <hi>Saw the King a hunting,</hi> I take it as a Truth, relying on his word. And this laſt way of knowing a thing to be tru, or giving Aſſent to it, is properly <hi>Faith.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. Two things are neceſſary, to make this Aſſent prudent. 1. That he who relates the thing to me, (the witneſſe) be not deceived himſelf. 2. That he doth not deceiue me. By reaſon of the firſt, we more readily credit an eye-witneſſe, than any other, becauſe a man is leſſe obnoxious to miſtake what he ſees, than what he hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, or knows by conjectures. For the ſecond, we eaſilyer beleiue an honeſt man, than any other: and we rather beleiue an honeſt man with an Oath, then without it: ſeing theſe are greater aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances, that he ſpeakes his mind ſincerely, &amp; doth not deceiue vs. So an Oath is the ſtrongeſt foundation of human <hi>Faith,</hi> wherefore
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:57387:32"/>by the Apoſtle it is ſayd to be <hi>To men an End of all ſtrife.</hi> Heb. 6.16. we will now apply this to <hi>Divine Faith.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Nothing can be more certain, than what God averres. Becauſe he can nether be deceived, being <hi>Omniſcient,</hi> or knowing all things: nor deceiue vs, by reaſon of his goodneſſe. So we are never miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken in beleiving him. But the aſſurance we haue of what any may ſays, even vpon Oath, is much leſſe. For 1. he may deceived, &amp; think, for example, he ſaw the King walking, when it was not the King; but ſome other Perſon like him. And 2. he may haue an intention to deceiue vs, by making vs beleiue, what he knows to be falſe: whence no man deſerues greater credit, than his perſonal endowments beare: &amp; to beleiue him further, is blamed in ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>He that is hasty to giue credit, is lyght minded.</hi> Eccleſ. 19.4. All this is expreſſed in few words by the Apoſtle: Rom. 3.4. <hi>God is tru; &amp; every man a lyar.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Both Phyloſophers, &amp; Divines enquire, whither the ſame thing can be the object of <hi>Faith,</hi> &amp; <hi>Senſes,</hi> can be ſeene &amp; beleived? &amp; commonly they conclude that it is impoſſible. At leaſt this ſeemes vndoubted of, that, <hi>De facto,</hi> it is not ſoe.</p>
                     <p>For the Apoſtle ſays, that Faith is <hi>An evidence of things not ſeene.</hi> Heb. 11.1. &amp; S. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> tr. 68. &amp; 79. in Ioan. <hi>Quideſt fides? Credere quod non vides. Faith is a Beleife of things, which we do not ſee.</hi> So that <hi>Senſes</hi> are ſo far from being the <hi>Objectum formale,</hi> the motiue of our Faith, that it doth not at all depend on them.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. The Apoſtles, being witneſſes of the greateſt &amp; moſt impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant truths, that can be, were carefull to perſwade their Auditory, 1. that they vnderſtood very well the things they preacht: &amp; 2. that they did not alter any thing in the delivery of it. And becauſe Eye witneſſes are commonly more aſſured, than others, they men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that 1. cor. 15.8. <hi>He was ſeene of me.</hi> 2. Pet. 1.16. <hi>We haue not followed cunningly deviſed fables, when we made knowne vnto you, the power, &amp; coming of our Lord Ieſus-Chriſt; but were eye witneſſes of his Majeſty, —. This voice, which came from Heauen we heard,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:57387:33"/>when we were with him in the holy mount.</hi> Here are two <hi>Senſes</hi> alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adged, <hi>Seing</hi> &amp; <hi>Hearing.</hi> And the beloved Diſciple 1.30 1.1. &amp; 3. <hi>Which we haue heard, which we haue ſeene with our eyes, which we haue looked vpon, &amp; our hands haue handled of the word of life. — That which we haue ſeene, &amp; heard, declare we that vnto you.</hi> And S. <hi>Peter</hi> being to chooſe a ſucceſſor to <hi>Iudas,</hi> required the choice should be made amongſt thoſe, who from the Baptiſme till the Aſcenſion adhered to <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Act. 1.21.22. <hi>Of theſe men, which haue compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed with vs, all the time, that our Lord Ieſus went in &amp; out amongst vs, beginning from the Baptiſme of Iohn, vnto that ſame day, that he was taken vp from vs, must one be ordained to be a witneſſe with vs of his Reſurrection.</hi> And <hi>Nicodemus</hi> doubting of ſomething, which our faviour had told him, Chriſt for confirmation of what he ſayd, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadged the like motiue: Joan. 3.11. <hi>We ſpeake, what we know, &amp; testify what we haue</hi> ſeene. And S. Luke in the Preface to his ghoſpel, aſſures, he writes, what he received from thoſe, who <hi>From the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning were eye witneſſes, &amp; miniſters of the word, &amp; having a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect vnderſtanding of things,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Whence is evident, that all that mention of the ſenſes doth not proue, that Faith hath any dependance at all on them; being only alleadged to make the Preachers of the Ghoſpel more creditable. But the only tru motiue of our Faith, is the <hi>Veracity of God:</hi> the Preachers of the Ghoſpel not delivering their owne word; but the word of God: &amp; the Hearers <hi>Receiving it not as the word of men; but as it is truly, the word of God.</hi> 1. Theſ. 2.13. This as to the firſt qualification of a witneſſe.</p>
                     <p>As to the ſecond, that <hi>They would not deceiue others,</hi> was evident from the whole life of the Apoſtles, free from levity, from vanity, from ſelfe intereſt, &amp;c. &amp; all theſe ſtrengthned by ſeveral other circumſtances, whereof each one ſeverally taken had ſome force; but taken altogether, they convinced all conſidering men, that it was more them morally impoſſible, that men ſo qualifyed, should wittingly tell a lye, or deceiue willingly their Auditory. All which
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:57387:33"/>things are hinted at in thoſe words: 1. Theſ. 1.5. <hi>Our Ghoſpel ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me not vnto you in word only; but alſo in Power, &amp; in the Holy Ghoſt, &amp; in much aſſurance (fullneſſe) as ye know WHAT MANNER OF MEN WE WERE amongst you for your ſakes QVALES FVERIMVS IN VOBIS PROPTER VOS.</hi> And 1. Cor. 2.4. <hi>My ſpeech, &amp; my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aching was not with entiſing words of men's wiſdome; but in demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſpirit, &amp; of Power.</hi> Althô it doth not ſufficiently appeare, whither the words themſelues contained that manifeſtation of the ſpirit, or the Perſon, who ſpoke, or both.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. All this was confirmed by <hi>Miracles,</hi> which may properly enough be called the <hi>Broade ſeale</hi> of the King of Kings: for as a <hi>Broade ſeale</hi> is a publicke Atteſtation of the Truth of a Patent, or Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to which it is annext, ſolikewiſe a miracle is an Atteſtation of Almyghty God of a Truth delivered in his name. <hi>Divina poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia etiam factis loquitur,</hi> ſays S <hi>Auſtin,</hi> Epiſt. 49.9.6 <hi>Men ſpeake by words; God alſo by deedes.</hi> And Origen contra Celſum l. 2. ſays the ſame. This language of God by miracles, is ſoo cleere, that even the moſt ſtupid vnderſtand it; &amp; yet ſo hard, that none can ſpeake it, but he, who is Almyghty. Hence Mar. 16 God is ſayd <hi>To haue confirmed the words with the ſignes following it.</hi> And Heb. 24. <hi>To haue borne witneſſe with ſignes, &amp; wonders, &amp; divers miracles, &amp; gifts of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> So when <hi>Chriſt</hi> our Lord Mat. 9.6. ſayd: <hi>That ye may know, that the ſon of man hath Power on Earth to forgiue ſins he ſayd to the ſick of the Palſye: Ariſe take vp thy bed, &amp; goe vnto thy houſe:</hi> it was to call God to witneſſe that Truth, that he had ſuch a Power: And God by doing the miracle did virtually ſay. <hi>I attest, that he hath ſuch a Power.</hi> And who, ſeing this, could doubt whither <hi>Chriſt</hi> had ſuch a Power, without doubting of the divine veracity?</p>
                     <p>Yet we muſt not hence inferre, that <hi>Miracles</hi> are the formal ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of our <hi>Faith.</hi> For as the only motiue, why a Proclamation is obeyed, is nothing elſe, but the King's will commanding: &amp; the <hi>Broade ſeale</hi> ſerues only to aſſure vs, that is the King's deede. Soe
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:57387:34"/>the ſole motiue of our Faith is divine veracity authorizing what that man, S. <hi>Paul,</hi> for example, preached; &amp; the miracle confirmes vs in the perſwaſion, that man delivers divine Truth.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. THe Doctor of the gentils, who laboured with greater ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe in converſions, than all the other Apoſtles, ſeemes in a particular manner to ſpeake of the <hi>Hearing,</hi> as conducing to the propagation of <hi>Faith</hi> in a ſingular way. His words are theſe: Rom. 10. a verſu 14. <hi>How shall they call on him, in whome they haue not beleived? &amp; how shall they beleiue in him, of whome they haue not he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard? &amp; how shall they heare without a Preacher? And how shall they preach, except they beſent?</hi> And concludes, <hi>ſo then Faith comes by Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, &amp; hearing by the word of God.</hi> Which words confound all en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſts, &amp; others who vndertake to preach, without being law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully called, or ſent by the Holy Ghoſt. But our preſent buſineſſe is to examin, why <hi>Faith</hi> is ſo particulary reſolved into <hi>Hearing.</hi> No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing like this being any where ſayd of any other <hi>Senſe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. This will be eaſily vnderſtood, if we remember, that, as is aboue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayd, Faith is an Aſſent giuen to an otherwiſe vnknowne Truth on the credit of another. This cannot be done, without the others thought be made knowne to me: to effect this ſome outward ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes muſt be vſed: for men cannot ſpeake to, nor heare one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as <hi>Angels</hi> do, by an immediate communication of thoughts;
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:57387:34"/>but are forced to make vſe of outward ſignes, to which ſome ſignification knowne to both partyes, is annext. Now of all ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, none more eaſy, or ſignificant, than articulate words, which with their ſignification are by the <hi>Hearing</hi> conveyghed to the mind of the Hearer: who by that meanes comes to know what the other averres, &amp; giues his Aſſent to it. And ſo Faith comes by <hi>Hearing.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Yet becauſe there are other ways to communicate our Thoughts, particularly by the eyes, <hi>hearing</hi> may be thought, not to be the only way to beget Faith. Men may ſpeake to the eyes, by geſtures, or motions of Head, Hand, or other parts of the Body, if ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning be annext to them. And in this ſort of language the ancient <hi>Mimi Greekes,</hi> &amp; Romans were excellent. Now that mute way of ſpeaking, by geſtures of the Body to the eyes, is much out of vſe, &amp; almoſt forgotten. As to other ſenſes, they can reckon but very few ſignificant ſignes: ſo Hearing ſurpaſſes all ſenſes in this, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of articulate ſounds, which it receiues, &amp; paſſes to the mind. Which I learne from S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> l. 2. <hi>de Doctrinâ Chriſtianâ,</hi> Cap. 3. <hi>Tuba, &amp; Tibia &amp; Cythara, dant non ſolum ſuavem; ſed etiam ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantem ſonum. Sed omnia ſigna verbis comparata, pauciſſima ſunt. Verba enim inter homines obtinuerunt principatum ſignificandi, quaecumque ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo concipiuntur, ſi ea prodere quiſque velit. Several muſical inſtruments giue not only a sweete; but alſo a ſignificatiue ſound. But words are the Princes of all ſignes, as well for their number &amp; variety, as for their efficacy in ſignifying.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Suppoſe I know a Truth, vnknowne to another, &amp; would bring him to beleiue it, how muſt I do this? 1. I chooſe words proper to ſignify my mind, to him. 2. J vtter thoſe words, 3. he heares them, &amp; 4. beleiues the thing to be as I ſayd, becauſe he is perſw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aded, I am not deceived, nor would deceiue him. Thus is propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Humane Faith.</hi> Now to <hi>Divine.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>That God can ſpeake without vſing any words, to the mind im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly, is an vndoubted Truth, ſeing the greateſt part, if not all Revelations were originally made in that nature, to ſome one Perſon,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:57387:35"/>who knew certainly not only what was ſayd; but that it was God, who ſpoke it. But whither this <hi>Evidentia rei atteſtante Deo,</hi> this cleere knowledge of God affirming it, is conſiſtent with Faith, or transferres that knowledge to another ſpecies of ſcience, Viſion
<q>Theiologi certant, &amp; adhuc ſub judice lis eſt.</q> But this is certaine 1. That it is not neceſſary to <hi>Faith,</hi> otherwiſe the miſſion of Preachers would be ſuperfluous. 2 That God did not vſe it to all men, to exclude pretences to Enthuſiaſmes of Fanaticks &amp; prevent the jlluſions of the devil. 3. That God ſeemes in propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gating his Faith to accommodate himſelf to the ordinary way of men. A King ſends his Embaſſadors, whither he goes not in perſon, with jnſtructions what to ſay, &amp; credentialls to procure beleife to what they ſay: &amp; their words are looked on as the words of the King their maſter. So God ſends the Apoſtles as his Embaſſadors (2. cor. 5.20) he giues them their inſtructions, to teach what they had learnt of him, &amp; for their credentials, he gaue them Power ts worke mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles. Hence <hi>The words they ſpoke, were not received as the words of men; but as they truly were the words of God.</hi> 1. Theſ. 2.13. And the <hi>Faith</hi> giuen to their words, was <hi>Divine Faith.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. That this was, &amp; is, &amp; to the end of the wold will be, the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary way, of conveyghing <hi>Faith,</hi> is evident. 1. Becauſe the Apoſtles propoſition <hi>Faith comes by Hearing,</hi> is vniverſal, &amp; vnlimited to any time, or place. 2. God ſent his Apoſtles &amp; Diſciples to Preach the Ghoſpel, without any expreſſe command to vſe other ſignes, or write bookes: &amp; indeed moſt of thoſe written, were caſual. 3. The Apoſtles ſent their ſucceſſours on alike errant, &amp; with alike Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion: &amp; we find in S. <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> that Faith was long preſerved in ſome countryes, without any written word. 4. <hi>Faith</hi> (by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle called milke) is ſtill by Parents, Nurſes, &amp; ſuch perſons in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilled into the <hi>Tender minds</hi> of Infants, even before they are able to reade. And if they conceiue it ryghtly, &amp; beleiue it ſtrongly, they haue tru divine Faith. 5. The ſame of ſeveral Perſons at men's eſtate, who for Poverty, or other employments, cannot reade the ſcriptures.</p>
                     <pb n="57" facs="tcp:57387:35"/>
                     <p n="4">4. <hi>Scripture</hi> may ſeeme an exception from that general rule, <hi>Faith by Hearing;</hi> but it is not ſo, <hi>Scripture</hi> it ſelfe being only an jmage of what is ſpoken, &amp; therefore belongs to the ſame <hi>Senſe,</hi> that words do Hence S. <hi>Austiu</hi> l. 2. de Doct.

                     <p>THe two firſt points are cheifely aimed at, in all this Preface, &amp; will ſerue to cleere the miſt which Humane Reaſon caſts before our eyes, that we may not diſcerne Truth from falshood, but may embrace a Cloud, for <hi>Iuno;</hi> &amp; leaue the ſubſtance for a shaddow.</p>
                     <p>Thô ſome <hi>Senſes</hi> may, yet all can never be contrary to <hi>Faith</hi> this is my firſt concluſion The reaſon is, Faith muſt be conveyghed into our mind by ſome <hi>Senſe:</hi> wherefore that <hi>Senſe,</hi> at leaſt, is not contrary to <hi>Faith.</hi> Which is evident by the ordinary courſe of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence teaching vs by <hi>Hearing, Preachers, Miſſions,</hi> &amp;c. Of which S. <hi>Paul.</hi> Rom. 10. Now if God doth at any time by particular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration inſtruct ſome, that is nothing againſt this Truth, ſeing thoſe thoughes ſo inſpired are conformable to what others <hi>Heare:</hi> &amp; by conſequence not contrary to all <hi>Senſes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. My ſecond Concluſion is: in matter of <hi>Faith, Hearing</hi> is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred before all other <hi>Senſes.</hi> The 1. reaſon, is, becauſe <hi>Hearing</hi>
                        <pb n="59" facs="tcp:57387:36"/>is more capable of conveyghing revealed Truths, than any other <hi>Senſe,</hi> nay than all the reſt together, it having more ſignificant ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, then all the reſt together, as is evident, by the multitude of ſignificant words.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond reaſon is becauſe God doth actually vſe <hi>Hearing,</hi> &amp; no other <hi>Senſe,</hi> to communicate to vs his <hi>Faith:</hi> For our whole Duty to God, &amp; our neyghbour, what we are bound to beleiue, &amp; practice, is all delivered ether by living words, in Catechiſms &amp; Sermons: or in Bookes, by dead repreſentations of thoſe li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving words.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore when ſenſes interfere in their depoſitions concerning any object of <hi>Faith,</hi> we muſt recurre to <hi>Hearing,</hi> &amp; adhere to that. For example: Other <hi>Senſes</hi> repreſent <hi>Chriſt</hi> to vs, as an ordinary man; <hi>Hearing</hi> ſays, he is <hi>The only begotten ſon of God, full of grace, &amp; Truth:</hi> we muſt beleiue this, &amp; ſilence the reſt. The reſt ſay water only washes from dirt the ſurface of the Body; this ſays, it purges the ſoul from the ſtaine of ſin: we muſt beleiue this. Why then should not this rule, acknowledged by the <hi>Zuinglians</hi> in other things to be good, hold in the Bleſſed <hi>Euchariſt?</hi> So that althô the taſt tell vs it is bread, &amp; wine, we may ſubſcribe to our <hi>Hearing,</hi> with S. <hi>Cyril</hi> nay with the whole <hi>Church,</hi> &amp; ſay <hi>It is the Body, &amp; Bloud of Chriſt?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But what if <hi>Reaſon</hi> takes the part of the other <hi>Senſes?</hi> Anſwer I will ſay ſtill, we muſt ſtick however to <hi>Hearing.</hi> For example: Reaſon ſays, the ſame ſubſtance cannot be <hi>One</hi> &amp; three; <hi>Hearing</hi> ſays, the ſame Divine ſubſtance is one in nature, &amp; three in Perſons: Our duty is to beleiue God to be ſo: &amp; to ſilence all reaſons to the contrary: This is what S. <hi>Paul</hi> vnderſtood, by <hi>Pulling downe imaginations, &amp; every thought contrary to his</hi> Doctrine: &amp; <hi>bringing vnderſtandings vnder the ſubjection of Chriſt</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I haue here delivered, as by a digreſſion, ſuch grounds, as if well vſed, will be ſufficient to reſiſt all the Attacks of God, &amp; his ſpouſés enemys. Yet they are ſoe cleere, that J think few can deny them,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:57387:37"/>without rejecting <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> in ſome very material points. Yet I haue not wandred, in this digreſſion, out of the ſyght, of my le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arned freind, D. <hi>Morley:</hi> if he retaines his treatiſe in his company in paſſing over theſe few ſections, he will eaſily obſerue, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but which relates to it. J now returne to him the liberty to propoſe his Argument, &amp; am ready to heare him.</p>

                     <p>Reviſor. Why you should ſay it is the ſentiment of the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> particularly, when it is common to all other <hi>Oriental Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians,</hi> is not hard to gueſſe at: you would inſinuate, what you dare not ſpeake out (it is ſo evidently falſe) that she [the Ch. of R.] ſtands alone in this point of Doctrine, whereas all other <hi>Chriſtian Churchs</hi> extant when your Reformation began agreed in ſubſtance with that of Rome, their mother, in this point.

                     <p n="2">2. D. Morley: <hi>Againſt this Poſition I argue thus: that which fruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trates all the vſe, &amp; end of ſcripture, cannot be the tru interpretation of any one place of it. But that interpretation of thoſe words of ſcripture, fruſtrates all the end, &amp; vſe of ſcripture. Therefore the Ch. of</hi> Romes <hi>interpretation of this place of ſcripture cannot be tru.</hi>

                        <hi>I proue the minor, or ſecond propoſition thus: that which neceſſarily implyes our</hi> Senſes <hi>are, or may be deceived in their proper objects ſo that what all men's</hi> Senſes <hi>repreſent as one thing, may be, &amp; is indeed another, muſt needes frustrate all the end, &amp; vſe of all ſcripture. But that interpretation doth neceſſarily imply, that our ſenſes may be, &amp; are deceived in their proper objects, by teaching that to be Flesh, &amp; Bloud which to all men's</hi> Senſes <hi>appeares to be Bread, &amp; wine. Therefore our interpretation of thoſe words doth frustrate, the vſe, &amp; end of all ſcriptures.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Reviſor. I deny the minor, or ſecond Propoſition of your firſt <hi>syllogiſme.</hi> To the proofe of it, 1.

                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2.

So your minor is falſe.</p>
                     <p>Thus your Concluſion, that <hi>Our jnterpretation doth fruſtrate, &amp; make voyde the end, &amp; vſe of ſcripture,</hi> that came limping in on two bullrushes for crutches, fals to the ground, one of them being broken, &amp; the other inſufficient, to beare ſuch a weyght.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Now I deſire you to shew your skill in ſophiſtry, &amp; anſwer this ſyllogiſme, by which I draw the ſame Concluſion, out of your Doctrine, &amp; expoſition of <hi>Chriſt's</hi> words: That interpretation which is plainely contradictory to the expreſſe words of <hi>Scripture,</hi> doth fruſtrate the end, &amp; vſe of <hi>Scripture,</hi> But ſuch is your inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of thoſe words of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Therefore your interpretation fruſtrates the end, &amp; vſe of <hi>Scripture.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The maior or firſt Propoſition is evident: for what vſe can be made of <hi>Scripture,</hi> to what intent can it ſerve, if we take the liberty to beleiue &amp; teach the direct contrary Doctrine, to what it delivers. For example, if when the ſcripture ſays: <hi>God Created Heauen,</hi> &amp; <hi>Earth:</hi> we ſay <hi>God did not create Heauen &amp; Earth.</hi> When it ſays: <hi>The word was in the beginning.</hi> We ſay, <hi>The word was not in the beginning.</hi> When it ſays: <hi>The word was made Flesh;</hi> we ſay: <hi>The word was not made Flesh.</hi> And ſo of the reſt. What can <hi>Scripture</hi> ſignify, to what vſe, to what intent can it ſerue, when ſuch interpretations are made of it? Soe my maior ſtands good.</p>
                     <p>The minor, 2. Propoſition is evident, that <hi>Such is your jnterpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Chriſt's words.</hi> For <hi>Scripture</hi> ſays; <hi>That is Christ's Body,</hi> you ſay: <hi>That is not Chriſt's Body.

                     <p n="4">4. D Morley: p. 4. <hi>All ſcripture being written for our learning,</hi> as S.

                     <p>Here <hi>Goliath</hi> like you bring a ſword to cut off your owne head. We ſay the words of <hi>Scripture</hi> are cleere, that whither we <hi>Reade,</hi> or <hi>Heare</hi> them, they ſignify the ſame thing, &amp; we vnderſtand them in their plaine, &amp; obvious ſenſe, as any man would vnderſtand them, who is reſolved to ſubmit his reaſon to them which we doe; &amp; not make them ſtoop to ſome of our fleshly <hi>Senſes,</hi> as you doe. Wherefore your method &amp; interpretation fruſtrates all vſe of <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:</hi> ours leaues it in its full force &amp; vigour.

                     </p>

But God be prayſed, the Church is not brought ſo low, as to want your helpe.

A thing is placed on an Altar, that <hi>Lookes, feeles, taſts,</hi> &amp; <hi>ſmells</hi> like <hi>Breade.</hi> What is that thing? God tells me, in the Eare, <hi>It is his Body:</hi> our <hi>Senſes</hi> tell me, <hi>It is Bread.</hi> Whither of theſe depoſitions shall I beleiue? That of <hi>Senſes,</hi> ſay you: that of God, ſays the <hi>Church,</hi> ſeing it is not impoſſible our <hi>Senſes</hi> should be miſtaken; but it is abſolntely impoſſible, that God should tell <hi>Alye.</hi> But, ſay you <hi>If we doubt of thoſe ſenſations of bread, we may doubt of thoſe of the words, whither we reade or heare them.</hi> Anſwer. Till you shall shew me, by an Authority greater then that of God himſelf, thoſe words, are ſomething elſe, J will beleiue them to be thoſe words. As I beleiue that to be <hi>Bread,</hi> which ſeemes ſuch, vnleſſe where God tells me the contrary. Do J paſſe thorough a market, by a Bakers shop, come into adining toome, we giue as full credit to our <hi>Senſes,</hi> as you, &amp; judg that to be <hi>Bread,</hi> which ſeemes <hi>Bread:</hi> only on the Altar, after Conſecration we ſay it is <hi>the Body</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> becauſe <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſays it is ſuch, &amp; the Church always vnderſtood thoſe words, as we doe.</p>

                     <p>Reviſor. I admit an equal certainty in both, taken by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues; yet <hi>Hearing,</hi> when announcing what God ſays, ſurpaſſes <hi>Syght,</hi> &amp; all the reſt; for we are to ſtrike to Faith, &amp; God's Truth; not to any elſe.</p>
                     <p>D. M. p. 8. &amp; 9. <hi>If there be no certainty of</hi> Senſes, <hi>in one thing, there is none in any thing, vnleſſe I know certainly what that one thing is; &amp; nothing can ſecure me, vnleſſe</hi> Chriſt <hi>in expreſſe words tell vs:</hi> Beleiue your <hi>Senſes</hi> in all things elſe, but only in the <hi>Sacrament.</hi>

                     <p>Reviſor. Whence ſo greate a concerne for the Authority of <hi>Senſes,</hi> &amp; ſo little for that of the <hi>Church?</hi> All is vndone, if the <hi>Senſes</hi> be corrected by the expreſſe words of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> whome they contradict, no hurt done, thô the <hi>Church</hi> be charged with errour, even when she follows the words of <hi>Chriſt!</hi> yet by the <hi>Church</hi> we receiue the word of God, &amp; its meaning too. Now why is an errour charged on <hi>Senſes,</hi> of ſo pernicious a nature, as to deſtroy all their credit, vnleſſe <hi>Chriſt's</hi> expreſſe words are produced to vouch it in all other things: &amp; one, nay many errours, charged on the Church, by which we receiue Faith, &amp; no hurt done? Js not <hi>Faith</hi> handed to vs by the <hi>Church</hi> of as greate conſequence, as that little ſcantling of Knowledge, which we receiue from our <hi>Senſes?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But why is an errour of <hi>Senſes</hi> ſo fatal to their credit? Haue they never deceived you, or at leaſt ſome others, of your acquaintance? &amp; do you therefore renounce them? Haue not ſome men, their eyes only repreſenting a greene medow, fallen into a quack-mire? &amp; do you for that reaſon either pull out your eyes, as vſeleſſe, or shut them, as deceivable when you walke? Are theſe Arguments of ſuch ſtrength, as to beate downe the expreſſe words of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> &amp; Doctrine of the whole <hi>Church?</hi> what times do we liue in, to what paſſe is <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> brought, when a <hi>Doctor of Divinity,</hi> &amp; a preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <hi>Biſhop,</hi> fyghts with ſuch ſtraws againſt <hi>Christ's</hi> words, &amp; <hi>Faith</hi> I</p>

                     <p>Yet becauſe old age is apprehenſiue, J will giue you a remedy againſt this groundleſſe Feare. You require an exception in expreſſe words: J will giue you one, at leaſt <hi>Aequivalentèr:</hi> It is a general Rule <hi>Exceptio in non exceptis firmat regulam. When an exception is made from a Rule, all things not expreſt in the exception, remaine vnder the Rule.</hi> Wherefore <hi>Chriſt</hi> having excepted only the Bleſſed Sacrament from the Depoſition of <hi>Senſes,</hi> he left all other things ſubject to them. So, ſir, althô you hold with vs <hi>Tranſubstantiation,</hi> when you ſee a floore, you may walke on it, without fearing a precipice: &amp; when you ſee a Chaire, you may confidently ſit downe, without Fearing it should proue a Cobweb. Wherefore Cheere vp, deare ſir, you may be ſecure, thô <hi>Chriſt</hi> be beleived.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. D. M. p. 9. <hi>Tis to little purpoſe, to tell vs, that this conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Bread into</hi> Flesh, &amp; wine <hi>into</hi> Bloud, <hi>is miraculous, &amp; therefore ſo monſtrous, as to be a contradiction to</hi> Senſe. <hi>Miracles are Appellations to</hi> Senſe, &amp; <hi>the end of them is by the evidence of our</hi> Senſe, <hi>to convince our</hi> Vnderſtanding <hi>of ſome thing, which otherwiſe we would not, or could not haue beleived.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Reviſor. You ſeeme reſolved to prevent our retreate, by ſtopping all ways imaginable to it: yet your main induſtry is to miſſe; not to hit, that which is moſt obvious: which I haue already taken, &amp;
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:57387:40"/>expect you, or any who takes vp the Cudgelles for you, in it. Yet I will in short review what you ſay of <hi>Miracles.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Miracles,</hi> when done in Confirmation of <hi>Faith,</hi> are deſigned to giue credit to a man, who ſpeakes in God's name, &amp; whome other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe we should not beleiue, they are by a metaphore proper enough called <hi>God's Broade-ſeale.</hi> Now as a <hi>Broad-ſeale</hi> is indifferent to all deeds, &amp; authenticates any, to which it is annext; ſo a <hi>Miracle</hi> myght confirme any Truth; but is determined by circumſtances to ſome one, rather then others. For example the man ſicke of the Palſy myght haue beene cured in Confirmation of the <hi>Trinity,</hi> or <hi>Incarnation;</hi> but was determined to teſtify that <hi>Chriſt had power to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit</hi> ſins by thoſe words, <hi>That you may know that the ſon of man hath Power to forgiue ſins, then he ſayd</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. I ſay when <hi>Miracles are done in Confirmation of Faith,</hi> for all <hi>Miracles</hi> are not done for that end. A <hi>Miracle,</hi> is <hi>an effect of God's Power acting contrary to ſecond cauſes. Natural effects</hi> are conformable to their inclinations, as that fire heates. <hi>Supernatural</hi> are aboue them: as that water juſtifyes the ſoul. <hi>Preternatural</hi> are beſides them, as motion of parts of water within themſelues. <hi>Miraculous</hi> or <hi>contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural,</hi> are contrary to them. Such was the cure of <hi>Ezechias,</hi> &amp; rayſing of <hi>Lazarus;</hi> for ſecond cauſes required the death of the firſt, &amp; the corruption of the ſecond. Soe S. <hi>Austin</hi> l. 26. <hi>Cont. Faustum,</hi> c. 3. <hi>Cum Deus aliquid facit contra cognitum nobis curſum ſolitumque naturae, magnalia, vel mirabilia nominantur. When God doth any thing against, or contrary to, the knowne, &amp; vſual courſe of nature, we call that thing a</hi> miracle. Wherefore when S. <hi>Thomas</hi> &amp; ſome other Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines ſay <hi>Miracles</hi> are <hi>Praeter, beſides</hi> the courſe of nature, they are to be vnderſtood, as J ſayd; &amp; <hi>Praeter</hi> in them is equivalent to <hi>Contra.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>That no <hi>Miracles</hi> are done, but viſible, &amp; in publick, you ſay, but can never proue, becauſe it is falſe. S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> proues this, Epiſt. 3. ad <hi>Voluſianum,</hi> by Chriſt's coming into the world without viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the virginity of his Bleſſed mother: &amp; his coming out of his ſepulcher, this remaming shut. See S. <hi>Thomas.</hi> 3. p. q. 29. a. 1. ad 2. Of
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:57387:41"/>which more hereafter, S. 14. Indeed were no miracles done in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate, it were in vaine, for men in deſerts, to implore God's aſſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance againſt a Lyon, or ſerpent, which would devoure or ſting them. But the contrary errour of Proteſtants in <hi>Brevint, Burnet,</hi> &amp; <hi>Morley,</hi> is grounded on another erroneous opinion, that no <hi>Miracles</hi> are done, but in Confirmation of Faith. Whereas it is certaine they are done for other intentions. For</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Whatſoever can moue God to vſe his abſolute Power in thw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arting the ordinary courſe of <hi>Nature,</hi> may be the <hi>Final cauſe</hi> of a <hi>Miracle. Pharaoth</hi> refuſing to diſmiſſe the <hi>Iſraelits, Miracles</hi> were done to shew it was God's will they should be diſmiſt. Exo. 7. A doubt being rayſed whither the Preiſthood were to be confined to <hi>Aaron's</hi> family, God decided it by the miraculous budding of his rod. numb. 17.3. <hi>Gedeon</hi> wanting reſolution to vndertake the war againſt the <hi>Madianits</hi> was encouraged by the dew on his furre. Iud. 6.4. The encreaſe of Oyle, to releiue a poore widow diſtreſſed by her cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditours. 4. (2.) Reg. 4.5. Waters cauſing a curſe, to eaſe a hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band of his Jealouſy. numb. 5.6. That there were no ill ſmells in the Temple, notwithſtanding all the <hi>Burnt offrings,</hi> nor flyes, where ſo much bloud was ſpilt, was in reſpect to that Holy place. The cure of <hi>Ezechias,</hi> for his comfort, or the good of the Royal family, which wanted an heyre. And who can tell how many other even private things may haue moved Almyghty God, to diſpenſe in the common law of nature, &amp; act contrary to ſecond cauſes? How often, are miracles done in conſequence of that prayer of the <hi>Church, Ad te noſtras etiam rebelles compelle propitius voluntates,</hi> drawing thoſe to a pious life, who had a perfect averſion to it? This you will ſay is no <hi>Miracle.</hi> But S. <hi>Anſelme</hi> ſays it is, &amp; S. <hi>Thomas,</hi> 1.2. q. 113. a. 10. &amp; reaſon proues it to be ſuch, becauſe it is contrary to the inclination of the will, <hi>Antecedenter,</hi> thô <hi>Conſequenter</hi> the will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents, being brought ouer ſtrongly, thô ſweetely by the Grace of God. And without all doubt, on <hi>The greate day,</hi> we shall ſee an infinit number of other Accidents, wholy miraculous, done either for the
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:57387:41"/>ſpiritual, or temporal good of both private, &amp; publicke perſons: which are at preſent entirely hidden from the eyes of all men, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven thoſe in whoſe favour they are done.</p>
                     <p>Whence I inferre, that this converſion in the B. Sacrament, may be <hi>Miraculous,</hi> &amp; yet be obſervable by no <hi>Senſes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. D. M. pag. 10. Moſes his <hi>Rod turned into a ſerpent, ceaſed to looke like a rod, &amp; in all things was like a ſerpent, which the Magicians rods (which were not turned into ſerpents) did not, &amp; water turned into wine, ceaſed to taſt or ſmell like water.</hi> Therefore all Miracles are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptible to ſenſe.</p>
                     <p>Reviſor. A falſe illation out of an inſufficient jnduction, as if I should conclude, that all men walke, becauſe <hi>Peter</hi> &amp; <hi>Paul</hi> walke,</p>
                     <p>D. M. pag. 10. <hi>There cannot be a change of one thing into another, without a mutual change of Accidents, as well as of ſubſtance: becauſe eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing conſiſts, &amp; is made vp of Accidents, as well as of ſubſtance.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Rev. What ſtuffe is this! J perceiue your <hi>Metaphyſicks</hi> are equal to your <hi>Divinity. Every thing conſiſts of, &amp; is made vp of Accidents, as well as of ſubſtance!</hi> I hope you will ſay a man is made vp of his cloths too. And not be much out of the way, if you ſpeake of thoſe of your degree, who are compounded of lawne ſleeues, &amp;c. in lieu of the interiour character. How groſſely are ſilly Phyloſophers miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken, when they define <hi>Accidents,</hi> by their ſeparability from <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,</hi> without its decay! <hi>Quod adeſt, &amp; abeſt ſine ſubjecti interitu!</hi> what, cannot a man become swarthy, by being expoſed to the ſun in the ſummer, or cold in the winter, but his <hi>Subſtance,</hi> his <hi>Body,</hi> or <hi>ſoul</hi> muſt be changed? Excellent Doctrine! And very fit to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke vs fall out with <hi>Tranſubſtantiation!</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As vnexpected is that other ſaying: <hi>There cannot be a change of one thing into another, without a mutuall change of Accidents, as well as of ſubſtance. Vnexpected,</hi> I ſay, from ſo learned a perſon; it being ſo far from Truth &amp; ſo contrary to experience, that to confute it nothing is neceſſary, but to shew you any newly dead Corps, of one knowne to you before. Is there no change <hi>In ſubſtance,</hi> when
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:57387:42"/>the ſoul is ſeparated from the Body? And do not many Accidents remaine, ſo as it ſeemes rather a sleepe, then dead? Do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leiue me, beliue your owne eyes, for which you pleade ſo earneſtly: Js there not the ſame quantity? The ſame ſituation of patts? The ſame organization? The ſame colour, moles, warts, skars, &amp;c. as before? How then can you ſay, <hi>There is no change in ſubſtance,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out one in <hi>Accidents</hi> too? Do you not ſee, that by pleading for <hi>Senſe,</hi> againſt <hi>Faith,</hi> you endanger the loſſe of both? And of your <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> too: giving me here a reaſon againſt yourſelf: For if <hi>Accidents</hi> remaine, when the man is no more (as certainly he is not, when his ſoul is departed) why may not the <hi>Accidents</hi> of <hi>Bread</hi> remaine, when the <hi>Bread</hi> is no more?</p>
                     <p>D. M. <hi>If there could be a ſubſtance without its owne Accidents, or Accidents without their owne ſubſtance, yet no man can be obliged to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leiue there was one without the other, becauſe it is not poſſible to judge of one but by the other.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Rev. All men are obliged to beleiue, what God reveales. So if God reveales that the ſubſtance is changed, althô the Accidents remaine, we are to beleiue the <hi>Change.</hi> But, ſay you, <hi>We cannot judge of one, but by the other.</hi> Why not, good ſir, if God ſpeakes? Can we not as aſſuredly ground a judgment vpon his word, as v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon any <hi>Senſe,</hi> nay all the <hi>Senſes</hi> together?</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Having thus reviewed the grounds of your judgment, in this place, let vs ſcore vp ſome Paradoxes of yours</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>Miracles</hi> are <hi>Appellations to</hi> ſenſe. What <hi>Senſe</hi> did Chriſt appeale to, when Luk. 4.30 <hi>He paſt through the midſt of a multitude of men, &amp; went his way?</hi> To what ſenſe doth he appeale, when he converts a ſinner?</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Miracles <hi>Are done to convince our vnderſtanding of a Truth.</hi> J challenge any man to shew in ſcripture any proofe of this ſaying, taken generally. Many Miracles are private, done for the releife of private Perſons. Doth not the <hi>Church</hi> teach vs to haue recourſe, to God by Prayer, in perſonal wants? And why ſo, if God on ſuch
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:57387:42"/>occaſions never acts contrary to ſecond cauſes?</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>The Magicians rods were not turned into ſerpents.</hi> Jt is expreſſely ſayd Ex. 7.12. Their rods <hi>Became ſerpents.</hi> J know Fathers are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided in this point. But why you should take to that opinion, which ſeemingly contradicts ſcripture, I know not, vnleſſe it be your cuſtome to regard it little. But if they remained rods, how had they the <hi>Appearance,</hi> or <hi>Accidents</hi> of <hi>Serpents,</hi> &amp; were by the ſpectators judged to be ſuch? Sure you may as well beleiue there may be the <hi>Accidents</hi> of <hi>Bread,</hi> without its ſubſtance, as the <hi>Accidents</hi> of <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents,</hi> where there never were any ſerpents. Againe how could <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> Rod made a ſerpent devour the reſt, if they remained ſtaues, is not eaſy to vnderſtand. That one ſerpent should ſwallow another, is no greate wonder, we dayly ſee the Dains ſwallow their young ones, vpon approach of danger, &amp; their limber yeilding bodys are fitted for it. But a ſtrong ſtaffe is not ſo pliable.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. <hi>All things conſiſt of, &amp; are made vp of Accidents as well as of ſubſtance.</hi> So that <hi>Accidents</hi> are eſſential to man, &amp; to other things: otherwiſe they would not make him vp, as <hi>Well</hi> as <hi>Substance,</hi> this being <hi>Eſſential.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus far we haue examined the proofe of your maior. Now co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes your minor. We will ſee how that ſucceedes.</p>

I answer that though indeed the</hi> Objectum formale, <hi>or</hi> Objectum quo <hi>of the ſenſe are</hi> Accidents; <hi>yet</hi> Subſtances <hi>are the</hi> Objectum materiale,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:57387:43"/>
                        <hi>or the</hi> Objectum quod, <hi>even of our outward ſenſes. My meaning is, that though</hi> Senſes <hi>do diſcerne immediately of</hi> Accidents, <hi>onely, yet mediatly, &amp; by</hi> Accidents, <hi>they diſcerne of ſubſtances alſo. So that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> Accidents <hi>alone, nor</hi> Subſtance <hi>alone; but the thing conſiſting of both, is the compleate, &amp; adequate object of</hi> Senſe.</p>
                     <p>Reviſor. This place ſeemes not ſo very proper, to procure by ſome shreds of <hi>Latin,</hi> &amp; a few ſchoole termes, the repute of a Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arned Clarck, when the ſame things myght as well haue been ſayd in plaine English in the text, as in the margent, had you ſo thought it fitting. I will not imitate you. Though you cite as many ſchoole termes as are to be found in <hi>Scotus,</hi> &amp; borrow hard words from <hi>Arabick,</hi> &amp; <hi>Hebrew,</hi> as well as from <hi>Latin,</hi> you will never prove that my eye diſcernes the ſubſtance, as ſuch. My eye repreſents a white object; but whither that white be in an egge, or in aſtone, or in ſome other ſubſtance, to that my eye ſays nothing. The ſame betwixt two egges: betwixt Chalke &amp; Cheeſe, &amp;c. And my eares tell me there is an Articulate ſound: but what it meanes, my eare doth not tell. Or elſe we muſt ſay our eare is changed, as often, as we learne a new language. Thus the <hi>Senſes</hi> only diſcover the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,</hi> or the thing <hi>Coloured,</hi> as it is ſuch; &amp; no further. The <hi>Eye</hi> ſees white on a wall, diſcernes if it be pure or mingled with blacke, or red ſpots, cleere, or darkish. The <hi>Eare heares</hi> the voice, &amp; diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernes if it be muſical, or not. The hand perceiues the object whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be hard, or ſoft, rough, or ſmooth, warme, or cold: But to judge that the white is Plaſter on a wall, the voice that of a man ſinging the prayſes of God, the thing toucht, the hand of a freind, is the work of the vnderſtanding, directed by <hi>Senſes,</hi> but paſſing beyond them. For as the vnderſtanding diſcovers the meaning of words, which the eare heares, &amp; vnderſtands not, &amp; theſe two acts, thô as different as ſoul, &amp; Body, are ſo linkt together, as they ſeeme the ſame Act: ſo it happens in other <hi>Senſes,</hi> whoſe Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons haue ſuch a connexion with thoſe of the mind, which they ſtir vp, that they ſeeme but one, thô they really differ.</p>

                     <p>To the 2. By our vnderſtanding we can diſcerne of <hi>Objects,</hi> &amp; <hi>ſubstances,</hi> by the meanes of <hi>Senſes,</hi> which repreſent their <hi>Accidents.</hi>

                     <p>Reviſor. To what intent this is brought, is not eaſily diſcernable: that <hi>Iſaac</hi> hearing <hi>Iacob's</hi> voice, ſurmiſed it to be like to that of <hi>Iacob,</hi> is very tru; but that he certainly knew him to be <hi>Iacob,</hi> is not certain: nay the aſtonishment, into which the tru <hi>Eſau</hi> asking his Bleſſing caſt him, is an evident ſigne, that till then he was not quite free from the errour, into which <hi>Iacob's</hi> goatish hands, &amp; greaſy clothes had brought him.</p>
                     <p>You ſeeme to think it neceſſary, that our <hi>Senſes</hi> either ſeverally,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:57387:44"/>or at leaſt conjointly be able to diſcerne betwixt any two objects propoſed. I think it were well, that they could do ſo; but do not beleiue, that any greate danger would hang over the world, if the <hi>Senſes</hi> should be found inſufficient ſometimes. They are all toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vnable to diſtinguish betwixt two glaſſes of water, two egges, two twins, a wolfe, &amp; ſome dogs, &amp;c. as hath beene often obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved: yet the ſun keepes on his courſe, &amp; women bring forth at their ordinary time. <hi>Pompey's</hi> father was often taken for his Cooke <hi>Monogenes: Pompey</hi> himſelf could not be diſtinguisht from <hi>Vibius,</hi> &amp; <hi>Publitius,</hi> both obſcure men, &amp; the later newly made free. <hi>Come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius Scipio</hi> was often ſaluted by the name of <hi>Serapio,,</hi> a poore <hi>Sexton.</hi> Theſe &amp; other miſtakes are recorded in <hi>Valerius maximus</hi> l. 9. c. 14. Yet that ignorance of the <hi>Romans</hi> did not ruin their ſtate. Why then are you ſo ſolicitous to provide a Remedy againſt it? Or if a remedy be neceſſary, why may not our <hi>Vnderstanding</hi> act the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecary</hi> &amp; provide it, as well as our <hi>Senſes?</hi> Methinks it should ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther belong to the vnderſtanding, to compare ſeveral objects to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, &amp; ſtate wherein the agree, &amp; wherein they differ, then to the <hi>Senſes.</hi> Otherwiſe we shall find it no eaſy matter, to fix the bounds betwixt theſe ſpiritual, &amp; carnal facultyes: for you will adjudge to <hi>Senſes</hi> what hath hitherto owned the juriſdiction of the <hi>Vnderſtanding;</hi> &amp; as to what will be left to this queene of our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultyes, our Reaſon, this shall onely be tenant at will to <hi>Senſes,</hi> who by the ſame Topick may claime the reſt &amp; leaue the <hi>Vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,</hi> as the <hi>Covenanters</hi> left the <hi>King.</hi>

<pb n="75" facs="tcp:57387:44"/>matter with the reſt, if poſſible: ſo J paſſe by theſe conditions, onely propoſing ſome queſtions.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. what certainty haue we, that there are no more ways to deceiue our <hi>Syght,</hi> than theſe conditions provide againſt? Cannot ſwift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, or ſlowneſſe of motions alter the appearance, of <hi>Colours,</hi> &amp; coloratums?

Do not <hi>Mountebanks</hi> find meanes to deceiue the eyes of their ſpectators, thô their eyes be good, the <hi>Medium,</hi> &amp; diſtance competent?</p>
                     <p n="2">2. What certainty haue we, thoſe three condition be exactly obſerved? As to the firſt: may not our eyes be defectiue, &amp; we not perceiue it? Doth not <hi>Seneca</hi> write of an old woman, who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of all roomes being obſcure, yet never would acknowledge any fault in her eyes, which were the only faulty?</p>
                     <p>As to the ſecond, may there not be a conſiderable difference in the <hi>Medium,</hi> enough to Refract the <hi>Viſual rays,</hi> &amp; we not perceive it?</p>
                     <p>As to the third, what certainty haue we, that the object is at a competent diſtance? Do we certainly know what is the exacteſt diſtance? Do not painters direct vs, who are vnskilled in that Art, what is the proper <hi>Diſtance</hi> to ſee a Picture? And in how many other things may the diſtance proper for ſuch a determinate object be vnknowne to vs? Againe: what certainty haue we of the tru <hi>Diſtance</hi> it ſelf? Doth not the moone riſing over a houſe ſeeme to touch it? When a thing is within 20. yeards, or a mile of vs, we diſcerne the different diſtances; but can we perceiue the different diſtances of ſeveral parts in the ſurface of the moone, or ſun? Or of thoſe of Other <hi>Planets,</hi> &amp; the fixt ſtars. How can the <hi>Distance</hi> competent ſecure our eyes, from miſtakes, when diſtance it ſelfe is ſo obſcure, &amp; vncertaine? When you haue anſwered all theſe queſtions, I ſhall require you to anſwer two more.</p>
                     <p>The 1. what vnqueſtionable certainty you haue of all thoſe An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers? Jf you haue none, then theſe conditions cannot ſecure vs

                     </p>
                     <p>Rev. J do not ſee that <hi>Faith</hi> is leſſe taught, or leſſe ſtrongly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leived, where <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> is taught, then where tis rejected. Or that ſeaſons would be changed, the Earth leſſe fruitfull, or men leſſe wiſe, or leſſe knowne to Relations, or Freinds, should God worke ſome other Changes vnobſervable to <hi>Senſes,</hi> &amp; reveale it to vs. We credit our <hi>Senſes,</hi> as much as you, where God doth not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veale the contrary: what more can be due to any Created faculty?
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:57387:45"/>Can we not prefer God's veracity before our <hi>Senſes,</hi> but we muſt abſolutely &amp; vniverſally reject theſe even where they conforme with Faith? All diſcourſe relyes on that principle: <hi>Eadem vni tertio ſunt idem inter ſe,</hi> which is hardly reconcilable with the myſtery of the <hi>Trinity.</hi> Yet we do not ſuſpect a fallacy in all other diſcourſe, becauſe we make no exception, but where God excepts, &amp; he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts only in that one myſtery. So we excepting againſt <hi>ſenſes</hi> only in this particular, where God excepts, leaues them at full liberty, &amp; in full credit in all things elſe.</p>
                     <p>D. M. p. 18. All matters of controverſy both Civil, <hi>&amp;</hi> Criminal <hi>Were by God's appointment to be decided by the Teſtimony of two, or three</hi> Witneſſes. <hi>Now how can any man beare witneſſe, if he be vncertain of what he</hi> Heares, <hi>or</hi> ſees? <hi>How is the Iudg certain he doth not condemne an jnnocent man?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Reviſor. I ſuſpect it not very prudent, to reproach Catholick courts of judicature with condemning Jnnocent men, &amp; beleiving vncertain depoſitions of witneſſes, at this time of the day. Thoſe who deny <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> can take in judgment a dog for a wolf, An jnnocent man for a Traitour, &amp; <hi>Peter</hi> for <hi>Iudas,</hi> as well as their neyghbours. Your Averſion to this inſenſible change hath left Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants as obnoxious to errour, as other folkes: witneſſe the <hi>Tall ſlender flaxen hayred D.

                     </p>
                     <p>Rev. Your <hi>Whys</hi> at this rate may reach from <hi>Geneſis,</hi> to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calypſe, <hi>&amp;</hi> hooke in, to boote, all <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Hyſtory,</hi> &amp; hold vs a long lent's Reading: which would haue contributed ſomething more to confound an Ignorant Reader, &amp; tire out one, who would anſwer you. Yet you will miſſe even of that aime, for one anſwer will ſatisfy all; all your queſtions being grounded on one falſe ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition. To cleere this J will vſe one example.</p>
                     <p>We are by Divine, &amp; Humane laws bound to obey the King, &amp; his Officers, according to their ſeveral degrees, &amp; the Authority communicated to them. Yet with this difference: that our obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the King is abſolute, &amp; without reſerue, in temporal things: that to his Officers is conditional, only as long as they continu obedient to the King. But if theſe command vs to take vp armes againſt the King, &amp; do what he forbids, we ceaſe to be obliged to obey them, &amp; are obliged not to obey them. Jf you ſay: as ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects we are bound to obey them, who haue Commiſſions from the King: I grant it, as long, as they continu in their duty; but no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. now multiply <hi>Queres</hi> vpon this ſubject till <hi>Doomes day,</hi> whither at their command, we are bound to take Armes, to come to a <hi>Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dez vous,</hi> to ſtand ſentinel, shut the gates of a towne, open them, ſeize a man, diſmiſſe him, advance, preſent, giue fire, retreate, &amp;c? To theſe queſtions one anſwer is ſufficient. Whilſt they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand nothing contrary to the Kings will, &amp; ſervice, they are to
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:57387:46"/>be obeyd: when we are certain they deſigne a Rebellion, &amp; rayſe men onely to deſtroy the King, &amp; build for themſelues on his ruins, we are not bound to obey them; but rather bound not to obey them.</p>
                     <p>J anſwer in alike manner to all your <hi>Whys.</hi> Our <hi>Vnderſtanding</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiues ſome knowledge from God, by (either immediate, or me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate) Revelation: &amp; ſome by our <hi>Senſes.</hi> It is a general duty to admit whatever truly comes from God. We may admit, what co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes from ſenſes, provided it be not contrary to what God averres: but if they depoſe any thing contrary to what God reveales, either in his written, or vnwritten word, we muſt renounce them, &amp; ſtick to the revealed Truth. So if they tell me athing is <hi>Chalke,</hi> &amp; God tells me it is <hi>Cheefe,</hi> they muſt pardon me, if I rather beleiue God, &amp; beleiue it to the <hi>Cheefe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus althô (contrary to four <hi>Senſes,</hi> but not to <hi>Hearing</hi>) I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leiue <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> becauſe God reveales it, I may beleiue that I ſee a <hi>Ship,</hi> &amp; go into it to croſſe the ſeas: that I ſee <hi>Bread,</hi> &amp; eate it, when I am hungry: that J ſee <hi>Wine,</hi> &amp; drink it when J am thirſty: that I ſee a freind, &amp; rejoice in his company: that I ſee a good action, &amp; commend it. That I ſee a crime committed, &amp; procure it be redreſt by publicke Iuſtice: that I reade a Hyſtory or heare a ſtory, &amp; beleiue it: In fine giue as full credit to the verdict of <hi>Senſes,</hi> as any <hi>Proteſtant,</hi> excepting onely that point, which God tells me ſenſes are deceived in.</p>
                     <p>This well conſidered, I ſee no reaſon for thoſe diſmal apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions from our beleife of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> as if by it Laws were made vſeleſſe, the ſword of juſtice broken, humane ſociety diſſolved, all Doctrine Divine, &amp; Humane made voyde, &amp; of no vſe, &amp; both <hi>Church</hi> &amp; <hi>ſtate</hi> brought to confuſion, &amp; deſtruction. Rivers may run vnder a bridge, &amp; winds blow from the ſame points of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe, <hi>Senſes</hi> left to their functions, &amp; we to their direction in all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things, though <hi>Tranſubstantiation</hi> be beleived.</p>
                     <p>D. M. p. 21. <hi>To deny the evidence, &amp; certainty of</hi> Senſe, <hi>is in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect to deny all Poſſibility of</hi> Learning, <hi>or of</hi> Teaching, <hi>or of</hi> Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,

                     <p>Reviſor. If the Heavens fall, we may catch larkes, And if an Aſſe flyes, he will moue ſwiftly. But what do theſe conditional Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions ſignify, while the conditions ramble in the imaginary ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of impoſſible <hi>Beings,</hi> &amp; are only the objects of fancifull heads? You will go hungry to bed, if for your ſupper you rely on thoſe Larkes: &amp; you will as ſoon performe your journy riding on a ſnayle, as if you expect the winged Aſſe. And <hi>Papists</hi> neede not feare <hi>Hell,</hi> or <hi>Purgatory,</hi> if they haue no other ſin to Anſwer for, than belei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving <hi>Chriſt's</hi> Body to be, where he ſays it is: and <hi>Adoring</hi> him there,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:57387:48"/>ſolely becauſe they firmely beleiue that he is there: having his owne expreſſe words for their warrant.</p>
                     <p>Concluſion of this Book. An appeale from the ſole competent judge, which knoweth, &amp; can determine, to one in competent, who nether knoweth the thing in queſtion, nor can decide it, is an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent ſigne of a deſperate Cauſe. You appeale from the ſole com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent judge, <hi>God</hi> &amp; <hi>his Church,</hi> to one incompetent, the <hi>Senſes,</hi> which nether know the thing in queſtion, the meaning of the words of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> nor can pronounce ſentence in it. Therefore your Cauſe is deſperate.</p>
                     <p>Otherwiſe thus: A ſentence of an incompetent judge is inſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficant. The <hi>Senſations</hi> are a ſentence of incompetent judges: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are inſignificant.</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Do not profeſſe my ſelfe a common champion, for all Catholicks, that either Attacke <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> or are At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tackt by them. Had God called me to that taske, he would haue endowed me with a greater ſtrength of mind, &amp; Body, a larger extent of knowledge, &amp; more leaſure from other employments, then I haue. Wherefore I confine my ſelfe to a much narrower ſphere, more proportioned to my abilityes,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:57387:48"/>viz, to that <hi>Faith, which was once delivered to the Saints</hi> Iude verſe 3. for which ſeing all are obliged <hi>Earneſtly to contend,</hi> I ſee my ſelf vnder that general obligation. As alſo to the defence of our Holy mother the Curch, by whome we receiue this <hi>Faith,</hi> without whoſe aſſiſtance <hi>Faith</hi> it ſelf, that precious gif of our bountifull lord, would fayle. As for the ſentiments of other private perſons, the being of the Church, the jnnocency of our Doctrine, &amp; the purity of our Faith, not depending on them, I think it no neceſſary duty to make good all they ſay, further than that cannot be deſtroyed without weakning Faith. And in alike manner I do not expect, nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, any should concerne themſelues for what I ſay, but only on like occaſions, that it be ſuch, as Faith would receiue ſome dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, werer it confuted. If any one, out of an opinion, that J go aſtray, or am in an errour in what J write in defenſe of the <hi>Church,</hi> will take the paines to shew it me, with Charity, &amp; meekeneſſe, J shall thank him for his labour, &amp; either acknowledge my perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal errour, if it be ſuch, or giue a reaſon why I do not.</p>
                     <p>Hence I was for ſome time doubtfull, whither I should review this <hi>Vindication,</hi> no body being concerned in it, beſides the name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe Authour of an obſure Pamphlet, whoſe merits are as obſcure as his perſon nameleſſe; eſpecially ſome of his opinions being far different, from what the <hi>Church,</hi> her felf, as well as divines hold; if his meaning be ſincerely repreſented by my freind D. M. &amp; ryghtly vnderſtood by me. And I think the <hi>Argument from ſenſe</hi> low enough, whither this <hi>Anonimus</hi> ſtand, or fall: althô M. Doctor page 4. is pleaſed to ſay, that if this Pamphlet falls, his <hi>Argument remaines not only vnanswered; but vnanswerable:</hi> as if that anonimus were our <hi>Hector,</hi> &amp; our <hi>Troy</hi> were to be defended by his hand, or by none at all. Yet I am of opinion, that my Reader will find ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in my Review of the Argument, to which what is here ſayd, will not giue full ſatisfaction, probably it will ſcarce be brought within canon shot of it. So my Review of this Treatiſe is a worke of ſupererogation, which J vndertake meerely becauſe there is oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:57387:49"/>giuen to handle ſome few material points, which further confirme what I haue ſayd, if well vnderſtood.</p>

WHo that man was, whome p. 1. you call <hi>Nameleſſe</hi> is not material: but why you should ſtile his Pamphlet <hi>Worth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe,</hi> I know not. I haue never ſeene it, to my knowledge, yet w<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hat you cite out of him (bating ſome phraſes, which to your po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite eares ſound harsh, as ſome of mine will) It ſpeakes it not much inferiour to ſome others. Then you giue vs a view of as much of the whole treatiſe as relates to your <hi>Argument:</hi> which I will omit here, being content with once viewing them, as they occurre afterwards.</p>
                     <p>The firſt thing ſetled by this <hi>Anonimus</hi> is that ſome <hi>Miracles</hi> are <hi>Senſible, others inſenſible.</hi> Or, as he ſays, ſome are <hi>Motiues to Faith,</hi> others <hi>Objects of Faith:</hi> which is very neere the ſame, as to our preſent purpoſe: This diſtinction diſgruntles you, who cannot ſuffer that any <hi>Miracles</hi> should be ſayd to be <hi>Inſenſible.</hi> But I will proue there are ſuch,</p>
                     <p>Becauſe 1. <hi>Chriſt</hi> was borne <hi>Clauſo Virginis Deiparae vtero:</hi> without any prejudice to the virginal integrity of his Bleſſed mother. This was a <hi>Miracle,</hi> as is evident: yet it was not <hi>Senſible.</hi> Therefore ſome Miracles are not <hi>Senſible.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. His coming out of the ſepulcher shut vp, with a greate ſtone,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:57387:49"/>&amp; ſealed, was it not <hi>Miraculous?</hi> Can two bodyes naturally be pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrated? Could his ſacred body paſſe through that ſtone, without penetration of two ſolid bodyes [ſuch were that of <hi>Christ,</hi> &amp; that ſtone] miraculous? And if you ſay <hi>Chriſts</hi> body paſt from the place in the ſepulcher to that without the ſtone, without paſſing the middle ſpace <hi>Ab extremo ad extremum, ſine medio,</hi> that skip will be <hi>Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous,</hi> &amp; <hi>inſenſible</hi> too. ſo it will confirme what J ſay. You cannot ſay the ſtone was removed, for him to paſſe: for it is evident, that <hi>Angel coming from Heaven roaled away the ſtone, who was found ſitting vpon it.</hi> Mat. 28.2.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Alike <hi>Miracle</hi> hapned, when he entred into the chamber, where his Diſciples were aſſembled. Here was again a penetration of two bodyes: &amp; by what <hi>Senſes,</hi> or <hi>Senſe</hi> was it perceived? They ſaw, they heard, they toucht him, when he was entred, &amp; ſtood in the midſt of them: but his very entrance, [which was <hi>Miraculous</hi>] was vnknowne to all, &amp; not perceived by any till it was paſt, ſo the Miracle it ſelfe was <hi>Inſenſible.</hi> Theſe three <hi>Miracles</hi> being ſo evident in ſcripture, could not escape the piercing eyes of the Fathers, let vs heare their opinion of them.</p>
                     <p>S. Ambroſe l. 10. com. in Lucae c. 24. <hi>Mirum quomodo ſe natura corporea peer impenetrabile Corpus infuderit, inviſibili aditu, viſibili conſpectu. It is wonderfull,</hi> [or Miraculous] <hi>how a corporal ſubſtance could inſinuate it ſelf through a firme impenetrable body, it being invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible at his entrance,</hi> Which was miraculous, <hi>viſible after it.</hi> Note that <hi>inviſibili aditu: his entrance inviſible,</hi> or <hi>inſenſible.</hi> By theſe that glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Doctor of the Church declares that all <hi>Miracles</hi> are not <hi>Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible,</hi> which is a novelty to this old D. D.</p>
                     <p>S. <hi>Augustin,</hi> Epiſt. 3. ad Voluſianum: <hi>Ipſa virtus per inviolatae Matris Virginea viſcera membra infantis eduxit, quae poſtea per clauſa oſtia membra juvenis introduxit. Hic ſi ratio quaeritur, non erit mirabile; ſi exemplum poſcitur, non erit ſingulare. Demus Deum aliquid poſſe, quod nos fateamur inveſtigari non poſſe. In talibus rebus tota ratio facti eſt potentia facientis. That ſame Power brought to lyght the Infants body
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:57387:50"/>through the virginal womb of his mother, which afterwards, when at mans eſtate brought that ſame body, through the shut dores into the Chamber. If you ſeeke a reaſon for this,</hi> It will not <hi>be wonderfull; if you require an example, it will not be ſingular. In ſuch things the Power of the workman is the ſole &amp; total reaſon of the worke.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Amongſt S. Auſtin's works there is a 2. ſermon vpon the ſatur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day in Eaſter-weeke, who ever be the Authour of it. In it J find theſe words: <hi>Quid mirum, ſi Dominus ad Diſcipulos glorificatum Corpus, clauſtris ſtupentibus intromiſit, qui illaeſo Materni pudoris ſignaculo ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuam mundi huius intravit.</hi> All confirm the ſame.</p>
                     <p>S. Gregory hom. 26. in Evang. <hi>Quodomo poſt Reſurrectionem Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus Dominicum verum fuit quod clauſis januis ad Diſcipulos ingredi po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuit? Sed ſciendum nobis eſt, quod divina operatio, ſi ratione compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henditur, non eſt admiranilis: nec fides habet meritum, cui humana ratio praehet experimentum.</hi> Thus the Apoſtle of our Nation. <hi>How was Christ's body real after his Reſurrection, which could enter to the Diſciples, the dores being shut? But we are to take notice, that the divine workes ceaſe to be admirable, when Reaſon comprehends them: &amp; Faith ceaſes to be meritorious, when it begins to rely on Human diſcourſe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Out of theſe Authoritys, it is evident 1. that thoſe three paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of Chriſt's body out of his B. mother wombe, out of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulcher, &amp; into the Chamber, were by the Fathers eſteemed <hi>Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous,</hi> &amp; indeed no man in his wits will deny it. And 2. that theſe paſſages were not perceptible by any ſenſe; but were truly <hi>Inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: Quod erat probandum.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>My 4. Proofe is the Miracle of ſtopping the fountain of Bloud of the woman, mar. 5. no body perceived this, beſides God, &amp; the woman her ſelf. Et had not he by enquiry forced her to owne it publickly before all the throng, nether we now, nor thoſe then preſent had knowne any thing of it.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. When our lord walked on the ſea, Iohn 6.19. for about thirty furlongs, or neere four miles. That walking on the waters was <hi>Miraculous</hi> from the beginning, for to each part of that fluid &amp; yeil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:57387:50"/>Body, whch his ſacred feete toucht, he gaue the conſiſtency of a firme floore. Yet who ſaw, who heard, who felt, or perceived this <hi>In the dark,</hi> till towards the end of his walke, when drawing neere the ship, he was deſcryed by his Diſciples?</p>
                     <p n="6">6. The caſting out of devils was not ſenſible: for nether the lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal motion of ſpirits, nor ſpirits themſelues are objects of <hi>Senſe,</hi> yet how frequent are theſe in ſcripture?</p>
                     <p>Laſtly Iohn 21.25. An vnconceivable number of miracles were ſayd to done by <hi>Ieſus,</hi> which are no where written, for the bookes would fill the world. It is rash to ſay, all theſe were done in the ſyght of many, there being no proofe for it in ſcripture, or Fathers. I know, that Iohn 20.30. <hi>Many other ſignes,</hi> not recorded in ſcripture, are ſayd <hi>To haue beene done in ths syght of the diſciples.</hi> But it will be no eaſy taske to proue, that none but ſuch hinted at here, are me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant in that other place. So it is very probable that of thoſe many Miracles ſome were done in private, none, or very few, knowing of, feelling, ſeing, or by any ſenſe perceiving them. Let vs now harken to our freind.</p>
                     <p>D. M. p. 4. <hi>No ſuch diſtinction of Miracles is found in the Ghoſpel:</hi> thoſe of <hi>Chriſt</hi> &amp; his Diſciples were evident to <hi>Senſes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Rev. Anſwer 1. this is not tru, I haue giuen you many inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of <hi>Miracles</hi> not evident to <hi>Senſes,</hi> recorded in ſcripture.</p>
                     <p>Anſwer 2. The deſigne of the <hi>Evangeliſts</hi> in recording the <hi>Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> was that men <hi>Should beleiue</hi> that <hi>Ieſus is the Chriſt.</hi> Iohn 20.31. &amp; ſeing they could not record all his Miracles, they choſe out cheifely ſuch as were publick, &amp; moſt convincing the veracity of the <hi>Tru Catholick evidence, Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> So <hi>Catholicks,</hi> to proue the <hi>Falshood,</hi> of the <hi>Tru Proteſtant evidence, Oates,</hi> make vſe of ſuch vntruths, as are publicke, &amp; confirmed by Oath, leaving out ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry many vntruths, vented by him in private.</p>
                     <p>D. M. p. 4. <hi>The onely end of all Miracles is to make men beleiue ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me Truths.</hi> This end failes in ſuch as are not <hi>Senſible.</hi> Therefore there are none ſuch.</p>
                     <pb n="88" facs="tcp:57387:51"/>
                     <p>Rev. Your firſt propoſition is abſolutely falſe. I haue often ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted you with ſeveral other <hi>Ends,</hi> for which God may do, &amp; hath done <hi>Miracles.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. D. M. p. 5. <hi>Aquinas contradicts himſelf, when he ſays ſome Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles are inviſible. For he ſays elſe where, that name comes from admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion now how can a thing imperceptible to Senſes be the cauſe of Admiration?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Rev. Anſwer 1. words in definitions ſignify not the actual Being; but the aptneſſe to be. <hi>Non ſignificant Actum; ſed aptitudinem,</hi> ſay <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſts:</hi> ſoe if the worke be ſuch, as when knowne it would cauſe Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration, that is enough to conclude that it is admirable.</p>
                     <p>Anſ. 2. Arguments drawne from the Etimology of words, are frivolous, &amp; inſignificant. <hi>Pontifex</hi> was named from making, or men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding a Bridge. <hi>Praeſul</hi> from leading a ſacred dance of the ſalij, Preiſts of <hi>Mars, Senatus</hi> as an Aſſembly of old men. Will you thence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that no man ought to be called <hi>Pontifex,</hi> or <hi>Praeſul,</hi> or <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nator,</hi> but who hath made or mended a Bridge, lead a dance, or is an old man? In Englisk Alderman comes from Age: yet who regards old Age in the Creation of that Magiſtrate? A <hi>Bishop</hi> hath his name from <hi>Vigilancy:</hi> &amp; a <hi>Deacon</hi> from ſerving: yet the firſt is giuen to ſome who are drowzy enough; the ſecond to ſuch, as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſerved. Some men haue tranſmitted to their ſucceſſours in Bloud names taken from offices, which no way belong to them, ſuch are <hi>Smith, Tayler, Butler, Warner, Fryer, Preist, Monk, Deane, Bishop,</hi> Cooke, &amp;c. Why may not ſome others do the like to their ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſours in Dignity?</p>
                     <p>Anſ. 3 cannot we admire things imperceptible to <hi>Senſes?</hi> Js not the <hi>Vnion hypoſtatical</hi> an object of Admiration to all <hi>Chriſtians?</hi> Is not God's birth of a Virgin, admirable? Can we ſufficiently ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire the loue of Gnd towards man, declared by the Paſſion of his only ſon? And is not the Divine Eſſence, &amp; Trinity of per, fons in one nature, admirable both to men, &amp; Angels? And are theſe, or any one of them, perceptible to <hi>Senſe?</hi> But enough of this childish Argument.</p>

                     <p>Reviſor. What difficulty is there, that God should do, what na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture cannot? And how greate ſoever is the dependance of <hi>Accidents</hi> on <hi>Subſtance</hi> why can not God ſeparate them, &amp; ſupply by his om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotency, the want of a ſubject, as the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> owne he can preſerue <hi>Subſtance</hi> without <hi>Accidents,</hi> althô it needes them very much? The being of an <hi>Accident</hi> is to <hi>Informe, ineſſe:</hi> &amp; that of a <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,</hi> is to recerue information, <hi>Subeſſe.</hi> Now if God can preſerue a <hi>Subſtance,</hi> without receiving <hi>Accidents,</hi> why not <hi>Accidents,</hi> without being received? Theſe two are correlatiues, tis tru: but Relatiues may haue a being without their terme You will ſay, they ceaſe to be relatiues, when the terme is gon, retaining only an aptneſſe to a new relation, when it hath a new terme: &amp; J reply this is juſt what paſſes in our caſe. For the <hi>Accidents</hi> after <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> haue no actual Relation to <hi>Subſtance,</hi> but an aptneſſe to one, when occaſion is preſented. And for this reaſon <hi>Accidents</hi> in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, are ſayd to haue an ex ſtence like in ſome ſort, to ſubſtance: <hi>Habent modum exiſtendi ſubſtantiae</hi> Yet it is diſtinguiſht from all <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,</hi> by that expreſſe, &amp; natural propenſion it hath to denominat ſubſtance, &amp; it ſuffers violence till it be reſtored to its innate man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of being in a ſubſtance, as a ſtone doth, when it is ſuſpended in the Ayre.</p>

                     <p>Reviſor. <hi>Quantity</hi> hath two effects; one in the <hi>Subſtance,</hi> which it informes: the other in the place, which it fills. The firſt is <hi>In genere cauſae formalis,</hi> as a forme: &amp; this effect of quantity is in <hi>Chriſt's</hi> Body in the ſacrament very perfectly, for his ſacred Body being aliue, or animated with his rational ſoul, it muſt be <hi>Corpus organicum</hi> which imports a diſtinction of parts from one another.</p>
                     <p>The other effect, as to the place it fills, is <hi>In genere cauſae effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entis,</hi> as an efficient, &amp; actiue cauſe, by a certain elaſticity, &amp; ſpringineſſe of the parts of a body, which thruſt backe ſuch bodyes, as on all ſides preſſe vpon it. which by moderne experiences is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in the Ayre, &amp; in alike manner may be proved of other things. Hence the ſame <hi>Quantity</hi> hath ſometimes a greater, ſometimes a leſſer extenſion in order to place, according as the ambient bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes do more, or leſſe, preſſe vpon it, &amp; its elaſticity is more, or leſſe actiue. Thus in the top of a very hygh hill in <hi>Auvergne,</hi> askin well ſtopt ſeemed full of Ayre; &amp; at the bottome of it, where the Athmoſphere preſt much, it wanted much of ſeeming full. Alſo a ball of Braſſe, with a little pin hole, being halfe fild with water, containes it all very well: till by being to a certain degree heated in afire, its elaſticity is encreaſed, for then the water &amp; Ayre mingled will breake through that narrows paſſage, &amp; fill the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber with a kind of miſt. Now if a <hi>Quantity</hi> of fiue foote, for example, by diminishing its <hi>Elaſticity,</hi> or encreaſing the preſſures of ambient Bodys, be brought to four, or three feete, why may it not be reduced to two, or one? Or by Divine Power quite ſuſpending its <hi>Elasticity,</hi> be brought to an vnconceivable littleneſſe of place, which would ſcarce deſerue that name. If fire, the moſt actiue cauſe knowne, had no effect on the three children in the <hi>Babilonian fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace,</hi> God ſuſpending its vertu, why cannot God ſuſpend the actiue vertu of a little <hi>Quantity?</hi>

                     <p>Which I do not ſay, to demonſtrate fully the whole myſterious manner of the exiſtence of the Body of Chriſt, in this Divine Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament (that being a thing to be beleived by faith; not to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, or even comprehended, &amp; perfectly vnderſtood by naturall reaſon) but only to diminish the difficulty of the beleife of it, by explicating in ſome probable manner a part of the myſtery.</p>
                     <p>You ſee, ſir, how eaſy it is to excuſe S. <hi>Thomas</hi> from the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, you charge him with: for it is no contradiction to ſay: <hi>A fire well kindled burnes matter combuſtible duly applyed:</hi> &amp; <hi>in the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace fire did not burne thoſe three young men.</hi> Both which we know to be tru, one by experience, the other by Revelation, why may not ſuch an obvious explication excuſe this greate Doctor, from ſo shamefull a fault as contradicting himſelf is? That all quantity fills ſome ſpace is a general rule: that in the Sacrament it doth not, is an exception from this rule. Can you not vnderſtand how a man without contradicting himſelf admits an exception from his Rule?</p>
                     <p n="3">3. D M. p. 10. <hi>Laſtly Thomas, &amp; all the reſt teach, that no other body can be in more places, than one at one time: yet they ſay Chriſts body in the Sacrament, is in many places at the ſame time. Thus they mantain what their church hath defined, though it be with doing violence to all the principles not of</hi> Divinity <hi>only; but of</hi> Nature, ſenſe, <hi>&amp;</hi> Reaſon: <hi>&amp; not without manifeſt, &amp; manifold contradictions not of one another onely; but even of themſelues alſo.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Reviſor. The contradiction you charge on S. <hi>Thomas,</hi> &amp; <hi>all Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks, is</hi> that we teach that <hi>Christ's body is in two places, at once:</hi> &amp; that we deny, that <hi>Any other body can be in two places at once.</hi> Where your firſt fault, is againſt <hi>Logick:</hi> for you beleiue theſe two propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions to be contradictions, &amp; they are not ſoe. For a contradiction is <hi>Affirmatio, &amp; negatio eiuſdem de eodem,</hi> the ſame thing muſt be ſayd, &amp; denyed of the ſame ſubject: now here is not the ſame ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject: for Chriſts body, &amp; other bodys are not the ſame. Hence it is no contradiction to ſay: <hi>Christs body is perſonally vnited to the word:</hi> and, <hi>no other body is perſonally vnited to the word.</hi>

                     <pb n="92" facs="tcp:57387:53"/>
                     <p>Your ſecond fault is more reproachfull, a lack of ſincerity in relating our ſentiments. You ſay, we teach that <hi>No other body,</hi> (but that of <hi>Chriſt</hi>) <hi>can be in more places than one, at the ſame time.</hi> Which is ſo far from being tru, that I will challenge you, or any other in the world, to produce any one, either Divine, or Philoſopher, of the Catholick communion who denyes to <hi>Any body a paſſiue ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity of being in two places, when God shall determine, in that ſame manner, that he beleiues Chriſt's body is in two places.</hi> And if I am diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved in this, I am content to be thought the Impoſtor. Had you conſulted either our Phyloſophers, or Divines, or even any of our yearly concluſions, you would haue found inſtances enough to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect your miſtake, if it were not affected: which I will not determine. I ſay <hi>In that ſame manner, that he beleiues Christ's body is in two places:</hi> becauſe I know the <hi>Thomiſts</hi> hold a body cannot be <hi>Extenſivè, Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calitèr,</hi> or <hi>Deſinitivè</hi> in two places, [&amp; the <hi>Scotiſts</hi> hold the contrary] but thoſe ſame learned men ſay the ſame of the Body of <hi>Christ.</hi> So your miſtake is vnexcuſable.</p>
                     <p>Your third fault, is, that <hi>Our Doctrine is contrary to all principles of Divinity.</hi> I know no other, at leaſt no better, <hi>Principles of tru Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity,</hi> than <hi>Scripture, Tradition, Definitions</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> &amp; <hi>Fathers.</hi> If you know any better, make vs happy by communicating them. Now J am ſure our Doctrine is not contrary to theſe; nay it is grounded on them all: &amp; this you knew ſo well, that you haue carefully avoyded all mention of them, as conſcious of your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicting them all, &amp; foreſeing that they are rockes, on which this <hi>Senſual Hereſy</hi> would ſplit it ſelf. Scriptures ſays, <hi>It is Chriſts body:</hi> Tradition ſays the ſame, ſo do Fathers, ſo doth the Church: ſo do we. Not one Egge more like another, than our Doctrine, is to theirs. <hi>What violence then do we do, to all the principles of Divinity?</hi> But it is not vnuſual, that men, who rob, cry <hi>Theiues.</hi> You know you cannot proue that we oppoſe any one principle of Divinity: ſo you never attempt it. Yet you would haue it beleived, &amp; <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore you beg it.</hi>

                     <pb n="93" facs="tcp:57387:53"/>
                     <p>Your fourth fault is, that you blame vs, as faulty, for going in matters of <hi>Faith,</hi> againſt <hi>Nature, Senſe,</hi> &amp; <hi>Reaſon.</hi> Sir we are Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> of him we haue learnt, <hi>To caſt downe jmaginations, &amp; every hygh thing, that exalts it ſelf againſt the knowledge of God, &amp; bring into captivity every thought to the obedience of Chriſt.</hi> 2. cor. 10.6. This we practice in this, &amp; other matters. If in this we are bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meworthy, condemne him, who directs vs to do ſo: if you dare not condemne him, you muſt abſolue vs.</p>
                     <p>Call to mind S. Auſtins words, mentioned aboue, in Epiſt. ad Voluſianum: <hi>Si ratio quaeritur, non erit mirabile: ſi exemplum poſcitur, non erit ſingulare. If a reaſon be found out, it will ceaſe to be admirable: if an example be produced, it will not be ſingular.</hi> We owne it is <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable,</hi> we profeſſe it is <hi>Singular.</hi> So we expect nether Reaſon, nor example to confirme vs in the beleife of it. That is, we are nether <hi>Socinians,</hi> nor <hi>Morleyans.</hi> Iuſt ſo we beleiue the ſame <hi>Chriſt</hi> to be borne of a virgin, thô nether Reaſon, nor experience confirme it.</p>
                     <p>Yet out of ſome other places of ſcripture joyned together, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares, that Chriſt's body hath been in two places, at the ſame time. For we learne out of Epheſ. 4.10. that <hi>He aſcended vp far aboue all Heavens:</hi> whence Heb. 7.26 he is ſayd <hi>To be Hygher then the Heavens.</hi> And Act. 13.21. we reade: <hi>Whome the Heavens muſt receiue, till the time of reſtitution of all things:</hi> that is till the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Reſurrection, he muſt remaine aboue the Heavens. Yet he was ſeene by S. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1. Cor. 15.8. &amp; Act. 9. Therefore he was in two places at the ſame time: In Heaven, &amp; aboue the Heavens, as the ſcripture ſays: &amp; neere the Earth, otherwiſe the Apoſtle could nether haue ſeene his Body, nor heard his voice.</p>

That of rayes, for example, on <hi>Moſes</hi> I ace. But you ſay, this was <hi>Senſible,</hi> which the other is not. And J ſay that is nothing to the purpoſe, as I haue often shewed. How ever it is evident enough: for it appeares by the words of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that he is there: &amp; our <hi>Senſes</hi> tell vs that he is not viſible there.</p>
                     <p>D. M. p. 19. <hi>It is no</hi> Miracle, <hi>becauſe it is not onely not evident to</hi> Senſe; <hi>but moreover it is contrary to</hi> Senſe.</p>

                     <p>Reviſor. The Apoſtles, the Fathers, the Church, the Faith full all over the world had &amp; haue a far different opinion of the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Communion of the Body &amp; Bloud of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> than you haue. S. Paul makes vſe of that conſideration to moue men to try them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues before they approach the Divine Table: leaſt by receiving it vnworthily, they become guilty of the <hi>Body</hi> &amp; <hi>Bloud</hi> of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> S. <hi>Cyril</hi> of <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> ſays that by it we are <hi>Chriſtophori, Bearers of Christ,</hi> jtem <hi>Conſanguinei</hi> his kinſmen.

Wherefore we ought not to think the worſe of the <hi>Church,</hi> for any fault committed by any of her children, ſeing she nether teaches, nor commands, nor approues it. But the <hi>Proteſtant Church</hi> cannot ſo eaſily cleare her ſelfe from ſuch ſpots, as the ſins of her children leaue: her Doctrine of the impoſſibility of God's Commandments, that we are nether the better for good, nor the worſe for bad actions (which are nether meritorious, nor demeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious in the praedeſtinate) &amp; of Evangelical liberty, the roote of all Sedition, &amp; Rebellion in <hi>Church</hi> &amp; <hi>State,</hi> &amp;c.

Who, but <hi>Atheiſts, &amp; Libertins,</hi> can blame this? Which is only a preferring Heaven to Earth, Eternity to time, the ſoul to the body, God to man: &amp; the Peace of a good conſcience, before the reproach of ſome bad men. Thoſe who think all Religions indifferent, &amp; that the King is to determine which we are to follow, the <hi>Hobbians,</hi> may blame this; but not a Diſciple of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> &amp; his <hi>Apoſtles.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>Reviſor. You take Mr. <hi>Creſſey's</hi> words in a very ſtrict ſenſe, that
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:57387:57"/>you may accuſe them, &amp; condemne him. Yet I think in good Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy, &amp; divinity too, Propoſitions <hi>In materiâ contingenti,</hi> althô they ſeeme <hi>Vniverſal,</hi> are not ſuch, but only <hi>Indefinite.</hi> For exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: Philip. 2.21. <hi>All ſeeke their owne; not the things, which are of</hi> Ieſus-Chriſt. &amp; Tit 1.12. <hi>The</hi> Cretans <hi>are always lyars, evil Beaſts, ſlow bellyes.</hi> Theſe <hi>Propoſitions</hi> are as to their forme <hi>Vniverſal,</hi> the firſt with a diſtributiue particle to Perſons, <hi>All:</hi> the ſecond with alike particle, of time, <hi>Always.</hi> Yet nether are truly <hi>Vniverſal:</hi> not the firſt, for nether S. <hi>Paul,</hi> nor ſeveral of the Apoſtles then aliue, <hi>Sought their owne.</hi> In alike manner amongſt the <hi>Cretans</hi> ſome were very good, ſincere, &amp; vertuous men. Such Propoſitions are fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent in common diſcourſe: v. c. <hi>All Spainards are Graue: All French men civil. All Italians cautious: All young men rash: All women talka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue: All old men moroſe.</hi> &amp;c. Which are taken as tru, becauſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly they are ſo, taken <hi>Indefinitè.</hi> But taken as <hi>Vniverſals,</hi> they are falſe, ſeing ſeveral inſtances can be brought, in which they are not tru: &amp; greate warineſſe is neceſſary in applying any one of them, to particulars. This is my firſt Anſwer.</p>
                     <p>Another is, that the <hi>Kingdome</hi> by an ordinary figure is taken for the governing part of it: ſo what is decreed by that, may be ſayd to be decreed by the <hi>Kingdome.</hi> Which is tru, thô ſome of this part oppoſe it. Thus a Peace, or Truce is ſayd to be made by the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick <hi>Of Venice,</hi> v. c. when the Senate decrees it, or when the major part of Senators reſolue it, althô ſome Senators oppoſe it, &amp; are for war. <hi>Livy. Vbi ſemel decretum erit, omnibus id etiam, quibus ante diſplicuerat, pro bono, atque vtili foedere erit defendendum. Plinius</hi> l. 6. Epiſt. 13. <hi>Quod pluribus placuit, omnibus tenendum. Dioniſius Halicarnaſſaeus: Parendum his, quae pars maior cenſuerit. Even thoſe who diſlike a decree before it be made, are bound to approue it, after it is made.</hi> Provided it containe nothing againſt <hi>Conſcience.</hi> Indeed we ſee in all Aſſemblyes, where things are carryed by plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of votes, all, even the <hi>NOES,</hi> are bound to approue the order, vnleſſe in ſome caſes, when they are admitted to a <hi>Proteſtation.</hi>
                        <pb n="101" facs="tcp:57387:57"/>Now the major part of the then Gouvernours of the Nation, or <hi>Kingdome</hi> decreed the taking of the <hi>Covenant:</hi> &amp; the major &amp; more conſpicuous part of the ſubjects may be ſayd to haue admitted that decree, althô very many, conſiderable both for number, &amp; quality, by ſome induſtry shifted off the taking of it. so the Kingdome may in ſome ſort be ſayd <hi>To impoſe the Covenant:</hi> &amp; alſo <hi>To take it.</hi> Thus we ſay, that <hi>England</hi> changed its Religion ſuch a yeare: thô a very greate number at that time did not admit of any change. And we may ſay that the Oaths are impoſed vpon, &amp; taken by, the <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome:</hi> thô ſeveral refuſe them. Were not Mr. <hi>Creſſey</hi> a <hi>Papiſt,</hi> I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leiue either of theſe anſwers would ſuffice.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. D. M. p. 8. His ſecond crime, is his ſaying <hi>The King was almoſt the only man, who remained ſo conſtant to his Religion, as to hazard for it the loſſe of his eſtate &amp; life too. This is falſe, ſay you, for many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands did the ſame.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Reviſor. In the ruin of others there was a complicancy of cauſes, which procured it: loyalty to their King, hatred to their perſons for fyghting againſt them, their eſtates &amp;c. For <hi>Naboth</hi> was not the only man, who loſt his life, for his inheritance. Now there was a time, when the demands of the <hi>Presbiterians</hi> ſeemed not intollerable to the King, who only ſtucke at the deſtruction of the <hi>Bishops.</hi> So Mr. <hi>Creſſey</hi> myght ſay, he was <hi>Almoſt the only man</hi> who ſuffred on the ſcore of his <hi>proteſtant Epiſcopacy.</hi> I haue not heard of very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ruined, &amp; killed, becauſe they <hi>Would not renounce the Bishops.</hi> Nether did the Rebels vſe to ſay: <hi>Renounce Bishops, or we will hang you.</hi> Several ſayd, renounce <hi>Popery,</hi> or we will kill you: &amp; many were killed by the Rebells for not complying. But to no Proteſtant was giuen ſuch ſowre ſawce, that J heard of.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. D. M. p. 8. Thirdly he ſays: <hi>Several of the wiſeſt, &amp; learnedeſt of the English Clergy were content to buy their ſecurity with a voluntary degrading of themſelues, from their offices, &amp; Titles. Which,</hi> ſay you, <hi>is injurious to the</hi> Bishops.</p>
                     <p>Rev. Why the <hi>Bishops</hi> should be vnderſtood in that propoſition,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:57387:58"/>J know not. In our Canon law, when only an inferiour, &amp; gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical degree is named, in odious thing's (as this it in your eye) the ſuperiour, &amp; particular is not comprehended. [vide C. <hi>Sedes Apoſtol. de Reſcriptis,</hi> &amp; the gloſſe vpon it] now Mr. <hi>Creſſey</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions only <hi>The Clergy,</hi> which is the loweſt &amp; moſt common degree. Wherefore nether <hi>Bishops,</hi> nor <hi>Deanes,</hi> nor any Perſon in Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical Dignity muſt neceſſarily be comprehended. What then doth offend you, in this Propoſition? Did not ſeveral of the <hi>English Clergy</hi> become Catholicks? Did not theſe degrade themſelues <hi>From the offices, &amp; titles</hi> which they enjoyed in the Church of England? Could they retaine them remaining <hi>Catholicks?</hi> Did not ſome of the English Clergy yeild to the ſtreame, &amp; comply with the times? Did not ſome beare armes? Did not one, &amp; he a Metrapolitan, lay aſide his Crozier, &amp; take vp a ſword? Did not all theſe degrade themſelues? May not theſe different ſort of Deſertors, be named <hi>Several of the English Clergy?</hi> Were it not in the book of a <hi>Papist,</hi> probably they myght ſo, &amp; the book paſſe without offenſe.</p>
                     <p>But Mr. <hi>Creſſey</hi> ſays, that he meanes the <hi>Vniverſality of the Bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hops,</hi> who ſeemed to degrade themſelues, by not filminating any cenſure againſt the Rebells. Anſwer: If he doth ſo, he ſays more, than what was neceſſary to make good his firſt Propoſition. You ſay that cenſures are not a <hi>Neceſſary duty of a Bishop.</hi> So you both agree that <hi>To cenſure</hi> is a duty of a <hi>Bishop,</hi> in time &amp; place: yet with this difference, that you think it is not a <hi>Neceſſary duty</hi> of a <hi>Bishop;</hi> &amp; he thinks it is: doth this diverſity of Thoughts make him Crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal? Eſpecially being conformable to ſcripture. 2. Trin. 4.2. <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue, Rebuke, exhort.</hi> Tit. 1.13 <hi>Rebuke them sharpely.</hi> Did not <hi>Chriſt</hi> giue power to bind, as well as to looſen? To retaine, as well as to releaſe? To shut, as well as to open? If on preſſing occaſions they neglect the vſe of that Power <hi>To bind, retaine, shut,</hi> is it not as much as to renounce that Power? &amp; if they renounce that, do they retaine the other? Is not Epiſcopacy one individual Power?</p>
                     <p>I deſire you to shew me any one <hi>Catholick</hi> country, where ſuch
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:57387:58"/>a Rebellion hapned, &amp; all the <hi>Bishops</hi> remained ſilent. By what doth <hi>Chriſt</hi> diſtinguish a <hi>Paſtor</hi> from a <hi>Mercenary?</hi> Joan. 10. The firſt ſees a <hi>Wolf</hi> coming, &amp; expoſes his life, for the defence of his flock: the later ſeing the wolf coming, runs away, &amp; lets the wolf worry his ſlocke at Pleaſure. Which of theſe two did our English Bishops imitate? But J leaue the application to the Reader.</p>
                     <p>But what can you alleadge to excuſe this ſilence in ſuch an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, as would make even the dumbe ſon of <hi>Craeſus</hi> ſpeake? you haue three motiues: The firſt is, that it was not ſeaſonable. But doth not S. <hi>Paul</hi> command that it be done even <hi>Out of ſeaſon?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The ſecond: that it would haue done no good. But that was <hi>De futuro contingenti.</hi> How ever in a deſperate ſickneſſe, is it not better to apply an vncertain remedy, than none at all? Would any one haue thought that the Layty had complyed with their duty to ſerue the King in his wars, if they should haue remained at home, &amp; ſayd, <hi>Our fyghting for the King will do no Good?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The third: you would not tempt God, nor expoſe your order to their malice, who myght extinguish it. The others are but pretended; this is the tru reaſon: here the shoo wrings: you thought it good ſleeping in a whole skin, &amp; were deſirous to keepe your mather's ſons out of harmes way. Indeed you would ſecure your perſons; not your order: for the Rebells had before vowed to roote out your degree; ſo that could not be brought into greater danger, than it was in. Wherefore your feare was for your dearly beloved perſons.</p>
                     <p>D. M. p. q. His 4. crime is ſaying: that <hi>Though many of the Clergy ſuffred, in extremity, yet it was not properly with an eye to their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; but to their fidelity, &amp; loyalty to their Prince. A bold &amp; vncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable Aſſertion.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Reviſor. Why ſo? 1. Becauſe ſays the <hi>Doctor, they did not tell him ſo.</hi> Anſwer: the factious Rebells did tell him ſo, declaring they did not perſecute for Religion; but for the ſecurity of the ſtate. Name any Proteſtant Parſon, hanged for being ſuch. Dr. <hi>Hewit</hi> was executed for ether real, or pretended crimes againſt the ſtate; not for Religion. So the reſt.</p>
                     <pb n="104" facs="tcp:57387:59"/>
                     <p>Your other reaſon is becauſe <hi>Loyalty is a point of your Religion.</hi> Anſwer: then <hi>Suſan</hi> is innocent: &amp; all M. <hi>Creſſey's</hi> fault comes to this, that he thought ſome crimes againſt the ſtate, were not againſt Religion. And if this be a crime, there are ſo many, &amp; ſo greate offenders, that you will ſcarce find a Iury to paſſe vpon them.</p>
                     <p>D. M. p. q. <hi>I think thoſe Martyrs who ſuffer in defenſe of the V. commandment, as well as of any other.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Rev. You will I hope find a place in your catalogue of <hi>Martyrs</hi> for thoſe <hi>Papiſts,</hi> &amp; <hi>Ieſuits,</hi> who choſe rather to dye, than <hi>To beare falſe witneſſe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="5">5. What motiues the <hi>Regicides</hi> may haue had to leaue vnmoleſted ſome obſcure <hi>Parſons,</hi> is <hi>to</hi> me as vncertain, as what you ſay p. 14. is improbable, <hi>Viz,</hi> that it was <hi>Out of ſeare of their intereſt, &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation in the countryes where they lived.</hi> They had cut downe the ſtately <hi>Cedar,</hi> &amp; would they ſticke at a shrub? They cut off the Head of your <hi>Church,</hi> &amp; would they feare the toe, or paring a nayl? They pulled downe King &amp; Nobles, the primate &amp; his Brethren: &amp; would they be awed by a country Parſon, ſcarce knowne even by name fiue miles from the place of his reſidence? To morrow I may beleiue this; not to day.</p>
                     <p>D. M. p. 17. <hi>Providence ſeemes to haue ſuffred, that thoſe heroical Confeſſors should be ejected out of their ſtations, that being diſperſt over the Nation, they myght ſow the ſeedes of</hi> Loyalty, &amp; Truth.</p>
                     <p>Rev. Very pretty! As if the Hay of a greate medow, were <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſt,</hi> by being gathered into ſtackes, or the <hi>Atlandick Ocean,</hi> by ruming into halfe a dozen <hi>Fish-ponds.</hi> What corner in all the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, without ſome of your miniſtry before the troubles? How then did this myſterious <hi>Diſperſion ſpread them?</hi> ſome of them tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled, it is tru, but haply as many did ſo before: &amp; what <hi>Seeds</hi> did they ſow abroade? You your ſelf were ſo wary, as not to ſpeake of <hi>Religion,</hi> till you had a <hi>Ieſuits hand</hi> &amp; <hi>word,</hi> that it would not be ill taken. A broade then you did not ſow thoſe ſeedes. Did you ſow them in <hi>England?</hi> who ſowed the <hi>Seedes</hi> of <hi>Treaſon,</hi> &amp; falshood,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:57387:59"/>of which there was ſuch ſtore, that it overrun the Nation, &amp; are not as yet weeded out? Were the <hi>Miniſters</hi> negligent in ſowing thoſe good ſeedes before the war? Or was their labour, &amp; induſtry loſt? And how was it so ſucceſſefull after the wars, that it should be a work of Providence? But you thought it honourable, that Providence should appeare in the concernes of your <hi>Ministry:</hi> ſo you bring it in, without well conſidering to what intent, &amp; purpoſe.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. D. M. p. 18. Begins to excuſe the Bishops neglect of <hi>Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication</hi> all the time of the troubles. Vpon which I aske him ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me queſtions: Haue not the <hi>Bishops</hi> Power to excommunicate? Js not that Power to be vſed againſt obdurate ſinners? Were there none ſuch from 1640. till 1650? Sure there were. How comes this cenſure to be forgotten? The <hi>Parliament,</hi> ſay you p. 21. could not be excommunicated. Ryght; but the Perſons in, &amp; of the <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> myght: &amp; if the cenſure did not bring them to their wits, nor reſtore them to their duty, it would haue fryghted many well me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aning men, who adhered to the others innocently. Which is one effect of cenſures. 1. Trin. 5.20. <hi>Vt caeteri timorem habeant.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>D. M. p. 22. <hi>We would not caſt our Pearls vnto swine,</hi> (<hi>nor our holy things to dogs</hi> p. 26.) <hi>nor expoſe</hi> Chriſt <hi>to contempt, who ſayth,</hi> who ſo ever deſpiſeth you, deſpiſeth me.</p>
                     <p>Rev. A pretty pretext for all hen-harted Prelates! The <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> &amp; <hi>Fathers</hi> were of a far different opinion, let one ſpeake for all: <hi>Non calcatur qui perſecutionem patitur; ſed qui perſecutionem timendo infatuatur.</hi> Aug. l. 1. de ſerm. D. in mon. c. 6. <hi>Heis not deſpiſed, who ſuffers perſecution but who through Feare of perſecution is infatuated,</hi> ſo as to neglect his duty. Had the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> &amp; primitiue <hi>Bishops,</hi> been ſo timorouſly prudent, <hi>Paganiſme</hi> had never been deſtroyed. <hi>Semen est ſanguis Christianorum</hi> ſays <hi>Tertullian: Plures efficimur, quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties metimur. Our Bloud is ſeed:</hi> our number encreaſes, by our being mowed downe with your ſwords. One graine falls, &amp; hundreds grow vp: One Chriſtian is martyred, &amp; thouſands of Pagans em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace his faith: &amp; the remnant honour <hi>Chriſt,</hi> &amp; his <hi>Vicegerents,</hi> even
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:57387:60"/>when they perſecute them. But this leſſon is not learnt in the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant Church.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>D. M. p. 22. <hi>Thirteene Bishops made a trial of their</hi> Authority, <hi>when they made a ſolemn &amp; publick.</hi> Proteſtation <hi>againſt the forcible keeping of them out of the Houſe of Peeres, &amp; were for that impeached of</hi> Hygh Treaſon, <hi>&amp; clapt vp in the</hi> Tower.</p>
                     <p>Rev. What is this to the purpoſe? Is <hi>Proteſtation</hi> an <hi>Epiſcopal Act?</hi> Cannot meere lay men enter a <hi>Proteſtation?</hi> Is your ſeate in the houſe of <hi>Peeres</hi> of Divine Ryght? Shew the canon of a <hi>General Council,</hi> or a text of <hi>Scripture,</hi> that ground either of theſe two things. If you can shew none, no wonder the thing should not ſucceede, which is not of your <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Function.</hi> But how comes that concerne for your ſeate in Parliament, to be greater than for all other things, how ſacred ſoever? You ſee Faith deſtroyed by <hi>Hereſy,</hi> &amp; you are ſilent: the Church torne in pieces by <hi>Schiſmes,</hi> &amp; you are ſilent: the Royal Power vndermined by <hi>Factions,</hi> the King's ſacred perſon endangered by <hi>Seditions,</hi> &amp; affronted by <hi>Inſolent varlets,</hi> &amp; ſouls poyſoned with damnable opinions, &amp; you are ſilent. You are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barred ſitting in the houſe of <hi>Peeres,</hi> &amp; you cry out ſo loud, as to provoke the Rebells to shut you vp in a Cage. Js this ſeate of gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ater importance, than ſouls, than the King's perſon, than Royal Authority, than the Church, than Faith?</p>
                     <p>D. M. p. 24. <hi>The</hi> Bishops <hi>thought they were obliged not to draw that sword of</hi> Excommunication, <hi>to cut nothing but the Ayre with it, or by striking on a Rocke, to blunt, or breake the Edge of it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Rev. A ſtraw is as good, as ſuch a ſword, which muſt ſtrike only the Ayre, or it will fly in pieces. Oh, but we muſt not ſtrike <hi>Rockes.</hi> Are then all the children of your <hi>Church</hi> as inſenſible of your cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, as a Rocke, of the ſtroke of a ſword? If ſo: whoſe is the fault, but yours, who haue the breeding of them?</p>
                     <p>D. M. p. 25. <hi>By</hi> Excommunication <hi>they had expoſed not only their</hi> Perſons; <hi>but their</hi> Order <hi>it ſelf to be ruined: for who can tell, whither thoſe, who impriſoned ſome for the</hi> Proteſtation, <hi>would not haue taken
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:57387:60"/>away their liues, if they had interdicted the houſes of</hi> Parliament, <hi>and excommunicated their adherents. And then what would haue become of the</hi> Epiſcopal Order <hi>it ſelf of our</hi> Church? Rome <hi>would giue vs no</hi> Bishops, Lutherans <hi>&amp;</hi> Calviniſts <hi>can giue none: other Churchs are too far off.</hi> Tarbox.</p>
                     <p>Reviſor. Did I not know your intention, I should think you pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varicated, your reaſons are ſo far from giving ſatisfaction to a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> ſo contrary to what hath been practiced.

The ſame of other queſtious, which pa. 29. You propoſe: why the Pope did excommunicate <hi>Henry VIII.</hi> Why not <hi>Charles V.</hi> Which are nothing to our purpoſe.

TO returne thanks to Almyghty God, for the Benefits re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived of him, eſpecially when they are greate, &amp; ſignal deliveryes, is a duty enjoined by the law of nature: &amp; that ſome ſingular favours should be acknowledged with annual ſolemnityes, is preſcribed both in the old, &amp; new law. Such were in the old, the <hi>Phaſe,</hi> the <hi>Phurim,</hi> the <hi>Encoenia,</hi> the <hi>New moones,</hi> &amp; the <hi>Sabboth.</hi> In the new, <hi>Chriſt maſſe, Eaſter, with ſuntide,</hi> &amp; the <hi>ſundays.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>That theſe <hi>Anniverſary Feaſts</hi> were gratefull to God, when duly kept, is evident, ſeing he commanded them; exacted their being
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:57387:61"/>kept: checked, &amp; punisht ſuch as broke, or prophaned them, by any ſervile worke. Yet that they were ſometimes offenſiue to him, is as evident as any thing in <hi>Scripture. Amos</hi> 5.21. <hi>I hate, I deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſe your feaſt days, &amp; I will not ſmell in your ſolemne Aſſemblyes.</hi> And <hi>Amos</hi> 8.10. <hi>I will turne your Feaſts into mourning.</hi> And <hi>Malachy</hi> 2.3. <hi>I will corrupt your ſeede, &amp; ſpread dung vpon your faces, even the dung of your ſolemne Feasts, &amp; it shall take you away with it.</hi> There is then <hi>dung</hi> in <hi>ſolemne Feaſts,</hi> for which God <hi>hates,</hi> &amp; <hi>deſpiſes</hi> them: for which he <hi>will turne them into mourning,</hi> which he <hi>will ſpread</hi> on men's faces, &amp; deſtroy them: as well as <hi>Flowers</hi> or <hi>Fruit</hi> grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to God, &amp; men. What is this <hi>Dung?</hi> What the <hi>Fruit,</hi> or <hi>Flowers?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Feaſts</hi> are as pleaſant as <hi>Flowers, or Fruit,</hi> when they are ſpent in conſidering the danger men were in, their inability to avoyde it, &amp; Gods mercys, in diſcovering, &amp; diſappointing it. Then than king God, for his helpe in over coming it, &amp; praying him to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu his Protection. To make themſelues worthy of this Bleſſing, men muſt be ſorry for their offences, &amp; reſolue not to offend againe. Theſe Feaſts ſo kept would entayle the like Bleſſings vpon vs. But they become as odious as <hi>Dung,</hi> when they are occaſions not to prayſe God; but curſe his ſervants: when men, in them, in lieu of magnifying his mercy, provoke his juſtice, &amp; deſerue the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheif they haue eſcaped by vncharitable invectives againſt jnnocents, to ſatisfy their Paſſion. What is this but to turne <hi>God's Bleſſings into curſes:</hi> to dry vp the fountaine of his mercy; &amp; ſtir vp his Anger: &amp; to draw vpon their heads thoſe, or greater punishments, than thoſe they eſcaped? In fine, to make themſelues vnworthy of his Protection?</p>
                     <p n="2">2. How little <hi>Fruit,</hi> &amp; what a prodigious quantity of this <hi>Dung</hi> is found in your <hi>Gun powder ſolemnity,</hi> is evident to any man, who ſees the ſermons made on that occaſion. This, which J now <hi>Review,</hi> containes 37. pages: yet all it containes of the delivery from the plot it ſelf, myght be ſayd in one. The reſt (excepting ſome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly knowne Truths at the beginning, as that <hi>There is a God,</hi> &amp;c.) is ſpent in charging that horrid plot on Perſons certainly, or at leaſt
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:57387:62"/>probably jnnocent, &amp; our Religion it ſelfe. Now if you, D. <hi>Morley,</hi> one of the moſt moderate of your coate, in preſence of his Majeſty, [whoſe mercifull diſpoſition, &amp; averſion to violent courſes, is knowne] haue ſo much of this <hi>Dung,</hi> what can we gueſſe of your hot headed <hi>Prophets</hi> amongſt their furious blind Zealots?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And now, o ye Preiſts</hi> (Parſons) <hi>this commandment is for you.</hi> (I vſe the words of <hi>Malachy.</hi> 2.) <hi>If ye will not heare, &amp; if ye will not lay to hart, to giue glory to my name, ſayth the Lord of Hoſts, I will even ſend a curſe vpon you, &amp; I will curſe your Bleſſings: yea I haue curſed them already, becauſe you do not lay to hart. Behold I will reproue your ſeede</hi> [your whole <hi>Miniſtry</hi>] <hi>&amp; ſpread dung vpon your faces, even the dung of your ſolemne Feaſts</hi> [5. <hi>noven</hi>] <hi>&amp; it shall take you away with it.</hi> Which words are ſoe cleerly verifyed in our days, of your <hi>Gunpow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Feaſt</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> that they ſeeme not an <hi>Obſcure Prophecy</hi> of a thing to come; but a Relation of a thing paſt, or deſcription of one preſent. How little you glorify God's name, on this day, I haue ſayd already. That God <hi>Hath curſed theſe your Bleſſings, &amp; ſpread the dung of this ſolemnity vpon the face of the whole English Protestant Church,</hi> is evident: for from the yeare 1641. that fyery Zeale againſt <hi>Popery,</hi> which your ſelues had kindled, &amp; entertained, fell on your owne Church, as <hi>Popish, &amp; tooke it away with it,</hi> &amp; <hi>Monarchy</hi> alſo: lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſcarce any hopes of reſtoring either. And againe with in theſe laſt fiue yeares how neere it brought both again to ſubverſion, &amp; vtter ruin, you cannot but know. And how greate was the danger of this Feaſt <hi>Being turned into mourning,</hi> as <hi>Amos</hi> foretold c. 8.10. is evident, whence our vigilant Magiſtrates were moved to forbid <hi>Bone fires,</hi> thoſe ordinary ſignes of joy: as the beſt meanes to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent ſome diſmall effects of that <hi>Malice,</hi> which you of the Miniſtry keepe ſtill vp at heygth, althô you haue found it fatal to both <hi>Church</hi> &amp; <hi>State.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Yet I am not convinced, that <hi>Prohibiting bone fires</hi> is a remedy proportioned to the evil, that is feared, or rather felt, as long as you by your reproaches, &amp; invectiues, are permitted to entertaine
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:57387:62"/>that hatred of <hi>Popery:</hi> it is only to cut off a branch, &amp; leaue the tree, to skin a wound, &amp; leaue the Arrow head in it: not to quench; but to cover a fire, which when leaſt expected will breake out into new flames. For if you are permitted to ſound the Allarme, what wonder thoſe who deferre too much to your words should take it, &amp; being fryghted out of their wits, by your repreſentation of their danger, they miſtake a <hi>Troyan</hi> for a <hi>Grecian,</hi> &amp; ſome blows levelled at <hi>Papiſts,</hi> fall on <hi>Papiſts in Maſquerade?</hi> In fine your <hi>Gunpowder ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons preach the People into gunpowder: &amp; then a little sparke is enough to ſet them on fire, &amp; blow all to pieces.</hi> And at whoſe dore muſt this lye, but yours, who diſpoſe all to it?</p>
                     <p>One obſervation more, &amp; I paſſe this point. Factious men, who make vſe of your labours to your deſtruction, are greate proficients in the Art of promoting miſcheife. Forty yeares a goe it coſt them much labour, mony, bloud, &amp; time, to get their armed <hi>Mirmidons</hi> about the Kings perſon: within theſe four yeares, few houres were enough to bring 20000. armed men. to <hi>Temple Barre,</hi> neere the <hi>King's Palace:</hi> &amp; who knows but the next attempt will bring them to, or within his gates. <hi>Deus omen avertat,</hi> ſay I, as well as you. But humanely ſpeaking, that can ſcarce be avoyded, without God's opening your eyes to ſee the miſcheife, you promote, or ſtirring vp publicke Authority to ſtop your mouths. Otherwiſe, <hi>You con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue chaffe, you bring forth ſtubble, your ſpirit, as fire, will devour you.</hi> Iſayas 33.11. Now to your ſermon.</p>
                     <p>In your 16. firſt pages I ſee little to the purpoſe. The greateſt part is <hi>De communi Sanctorum,</hi> appliable to other things, mingled with ſome ſlips, through inadvertency: ſuch J take that to be, p. 13. S. <hi>Paul ſaw it with his owne eyes:</hi> when he ſays himſelf, 1. cor. 1.11. <hi>He heard it from thoſe of Chloe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. D. M. p. 17. <hi>This horrid conſpiracy, to which the Actors were prompted by ſome</hi> Doctrines <hi>of their Religion.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Rev. That it was a <hi>Horrid conſpiracy,</hi> J grant; but not, that the Doctrines of our <hi>Religion</hi> prompted the Actors vnto it. Let expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:57387:63"/>decide the cauſe. What Kings more abſolute in their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions, then <hi>Catholicks?</hi> In England when were our Kings more honoured, &amp; readily obeyed, by their ſubjects, than when <hi>Papiſts?</hi> when more beloved by their freinds, and Allyes, when more feared by their Enemyes, than when <hi>Papiſts? Popery</hi> teachs to giue every one his due: to God, what is Gods, &amp; to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> what is his: that is, it teaches to obey both <hi>Prelate</hi> &amp; <hi>Prince,</hi> both <hi>ſpiritual</hi> &amp; <hi>tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Magiſtrate.</hi> Whereas your Reformation quite caſt off obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the <hi>Prelate,</hi> &amp; ſo weakened that to the <hi>Prince,</hi> that this broke too. And althô you haue endeavoured to piece it againe, yet the common voice ſays, that without a doſe of <hi>Popery,</hi> or <hi>Popish principles,</hi> it can never arriue to its former vigour. So different are the judgments of the world from your pretences! But what are theſe <hi>Doctrines?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>D. M. p. 19, <hi>That of the</hi> Popes ſupremacy <hi>not</hi> of order, <hi>or</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedency <hi>Only; but of</hi> Authority, <hi>&amp;</hi> juriſdiction.</p>
                     <p>Rev. That ſupremacy had been acknowledged 1000. yeares, &amp; yet <hi>Monarchy</hi> remained in its vigour: &amp; ſo it continues in <hi>Spaine,</hi> &amp; <hi>France,</hi> &amp; <hi>Germany,</hi> without any bad effect to <hi>Monarchy.</hi> But you lay the faults of your <hi>Reformation</hi> at our dore. Then you cite ſome hard opinions out of <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> &amp; <hi>Aug. Steucus,</hi> who being no Rules of our Faith, I paſſe by them.</p>
                     <p>D. M. p. 21. <hi>The Clergy was forbidden to marry that they myght haue no tye to their country: &amp; exempted from ſecular juriſdiction, that it myght depend only on the Pope.</hi>

                     <p>Rev. You ſpeake more dogmatically, than the <hi>Pope,</hi> for in doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinal points, he giues a Reaſon, &amp; you giue none. You may find other motiues for theſe two points, if you conſult our <hi>Divines,</hi> or <hi>Controvertiſts.</hi>

                        <hi>Philips,</hi> before the Rabble; but ſcarce in one of your degree before ſuch an Auditory. If <hi>Oaths</hi> to vs are ſuch <hi>Cobwebs,</hi> why do ſo many of vs looſe their Eſtates, their Libertys, &amp; their Liues, rather than take ſome? Why doth the Parliament take the Paines to frame, &amp; impoſe them? You contradict experience, &amp; I feare, your owne Conſcience.</p>
                     <p>D. M. p. 23. <hi>Another horrid Doctrine, is the obligation of Preiſts, to conceale what they heare in</hi> Confeſſion. And you mention <hi>Clement,</hi> &amp; <hi>Ravaillac.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Rev. You myght with as much reaſon, haue mentioned <hi>Brutus</hi> &amp; <hi>Pauſanias:</hi> for it doth not appeare that ether of theſe two ever diſcovered their deſigne in <hi>Confeſſion.</hi> The ſecret of <hi>Confeſſion</hi> may bring a Ruffian to diſcover his damnable intention to a <hi>Preiſt,</hi> by whome he may be diverted, or the miſcheife prevented: &amp; Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes teach how, without breaking the ſeale of Confeſſion. But it gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues no advantage to a <hi>Preiſt</hi> to communicate bad deſignes, becauſe the obligation of ſecrecy binds not the <hi>Penitent.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>D. M. p. 24. <hi>It is not enough to ſay, theſe are not</hi> Doctrines <hi>of the</hi> Church of Rome; <hi>but only of ſome particular</hi> Doctors <hi>of it: becauſe they never were condemned by the repreſentatiue Body of that Church,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Rev. A diſcourſe much below your ſelf, &amp; your Auditory, yet you repeate it againe p. 30. What obligation is there, that if one do a thing contrary to his duty, all thoſe of his Communion muſt by ſome publicke act declare againſt it. Doth a man ſuſpect his ſon, of taking a purſe, if another doth ſo? Or his wife of being vnfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to him, becauſe his neyghbour's wife is ſo? Or you &amp; your breth, ren, to be in a readineſſe to take vp Armes againſt the King, becauſe a <hi>Bishop</hi> did ſo? Becauſe that man's ſon, or wife, or the <hi>Bishops</hi> never declared their abhorrence, of thoſe ſeveral Crimes?</p>
                     <p>Moreover ſome of the Doctrines, you mention, are cenſured by our Church, in <hi>Santarelli,</hi> &amp; <hi>Becanus.</hi> In France, &amp; Rome it ſelf: which you knew, &amp; therefore ſay <hi>They were not condemned by the repreſentatiue body of the Church,</hi> that is, a general Council. But if
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:57387:64"/>you reade the laſt Chapter of S. Auſtins fourth book <hi>Contra duas Epiſtolas Pelagianorum,</hi> you will find that generall Councils are not always neceſſary to condemne emergent errours, that many more haue beene condemned out of, than in Councils; that without an abſolute neceſſity [all other meanes fayling] the Church vſes not to haue recours to a general Council. Indeed were it not ſo, ſuch Councils muſt ether be perpetual, &amp; ſo the cheife Paſtors would be always abſent from their flocks, or be ſo frequent, that they would ſcarce ever reſide with it. Wherefore God hath appointed in the Church for ordinary &amp; more frequent occaſions inferiour Tribunals, ſome of which haue declared already their diſlike of ſome of theſe Doctrines: others they leaue, as likely to wither of themſelues, <hi>Sicut foenum tectorum,</hi> as hay on the houſe top: &amp; ſome it may be are left, as not being legally knowne to thoſe Tribunalls. How ever ether there is, or is not, an obligation to condemne all bad Doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes? If there is none, why do you blame our Church for omitting it? Jf there is one, how can you excuſe your owne Church, which never complyed with that Duty? In reality there is an obligation, which being a poſitiue precept, obliges in time &amp; place; not alwais: &amp; is ſo kept by vs; not at all by you.</p>
                     <p>D. M. p. 25. <hi>Bishop Andrews tells vs, that Paul</hi> IV. <hi>offred to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme all that Q.</hi> Eliſabeth <hi>had done</hi> in Church <hi>affayres, vpon condition she would owne his</hi> ſupremacy.</p>
                     <p>Rev. This requires a better proofe, than the bare word of one intereſſed man. How ever if it were ſo, the guilt of <hi>Schiſme</hi> ſticks cloſer to you: &amp; you may ſee how much you were miſtaken, when you told F. <hi>Darcy</hi> at <hi>Bruſſelles,</hi> that one <hi>Side was reſolved before hand to relax nothing.</hi> But it is an ordinary cuſtome amongſt you, to make vs hold contradictory things, as they ſerue your turne.</p>
                     <p>D. M. p. 26. <hi>The eaſterne ſchiſme was cauſed by the Pope's aſſuming the title of vniverſal Bishop: &amp; of being Head of the whole Church.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Rev. That cannot be: for the Pope never tooke the title of <hi>Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Bishop.</hi> And that other, <hi>Head of the Church,</hi> was acknowledged

                     <p>Rev. The law of nature obliges you to ſeeke <hi>Self preſervation:</hi> but <hi>Prudence</hi> muſt guide you in the choice of proper meanes to find it. And <hi>Experience</hi> is the beſt rule of <hi>Prudence:</hi> &amp; this demonſtrates, that <hi>Perſecution of Papiſts,</hi> is the way to <hi>Ruin;</hi> not to <hi>Preſerue</hi> your ſelues. For about 70. yeares, through the mercy of our <hi>Kings</hi> we haue had but two <hi>Perſecutions</hi> of <hi>Papiſts,</hi> &amp; both opened a dore to Factious. Rebells, who the firſt time ruined both <hi>Church,</hi> &amp; <hi>State:</hi> &amp; the ſecond time brought both to the brink of a precipice, &amp; downe both had gon, had there not been put a ſtop to the preceedings againſt <hi>Papiſts.</hi> So the <hi>Perſecution of Papists</hi> is ſuch a remedy to your fainting Church, as cutting his throate is to a man in an Ague.</p>

                     <p>Rev. I wish you had explicated, what you meane by <hi>Iealous times?</hi> Whither ſuch as are occaſioned by ſome Actions, or deſignes of <hi>Papiſts,</hi> againſt your <hi>Church,</hi> or <hi>State?</hi> Or without any cauſe, beſides the phancy of ſome melancholy Parſon, or the <hi>Calumnyes</hi> of ſome ſuch Flagitious wretches, as of late appeared on the <hi>English stage?</hi> If your jealouſyes are are of the firſt ſort, no body will blame your ſeverity, vpon the guilty Perſons.

                     <p n="1">1. I Was very much ſurprized, to ſee this letter made publick, much more, that is was by your order, by reaſon of the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter you bore, of <hi>Confeſſor</hi> to her R. H. For a far different reaſon, there ought to be as greate a freedome of communication betwixt <hi>Confeſſor,</hi> &amp; <hi>Penitent,</hi> in matters of <hi>Conſcience,</hi> as to the ſoul, as
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:57387:66"/>betwixt <hi>Man,</hi> &amp; <hi>Wife,</hi> as to the <hi>Body.</hi> Which liberty is much chec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eed, with the thought, that ſuch things may ſome day become pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blicke. The people of <hi>Athens</hi> would not let <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Macedon's</hi> let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to his wife <hi>Olimpias</hi> be opened, thô he were an Enemy, as thinking the converſe betwixt ſuch perſons, ſacred. With more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ought thoſe betwixt <hi>Confeſſor,</hi> &amp; <hi>Penitent,</hi> be looked on as ſuch. But it ſeemes in the <hi>Protestant Church</hi> nether ſecret is regarded: for that betwixt <hi>Man</hi> &amp; <hi>Wife</hi> was broken by order of <hi>Parliament,</hi> for the printing the letters of king <hi>Charles I.</hi> to the Queene, &amp; you, a father of the <hi>Proteſtant Church</hi> publish thoſe betwixt your <hi>Penitent,</hi> &amp; you. And J heare that ſome perſons of your <hi>Communion</hi> haue found, that they had not made their <hi>Confeſſions</hi> themſelues to <hi>Mute fishes.</hi> Witneſſe Capt. <hi>Hinde.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Catholickes haue indeed printed a letter of a <hi>Preiſt</hi> to my Lord of <hi>Stafford,</hi> &amp; ſomething written as is beleived by her R. H. but nether of theſe comes home to the point of this letter. For what was written by her R. H. was probably deſigned to be ſeene, at le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſt it was not written to her <hi>Confeſſor:</hi> nor was that letter to my Lord of <hi>Stafford,</hi> by his <hi>Confeſſor,</hi> it myght, &amp; probably did come from one, who never ſaw him, nor knew of him, but onely that he was preparing for Death.</p>
                     <p>Another reaſon, why I was ſurprized at the ſyght of this letter, is that it doth in a manner confirme the Report of her being a <hi>pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist.</hi> Now this lady being by alliance entred into the <hi>Royal Family,</hi> &amp; making a very eminent figure in it, I thought shee should haue beene partaker of that priviledge, that none should publish their being <hi>Papiſts:</hi> for if this be <hi>Treaſon</hi> by law, when ſayd of the head of that Family, it ought to be held a hainous offence, when ſpoken of others. Beſides this, we learne in Tobie, 12.11. That it is <hi>Good to reveale the ſecrets of God; &amp; to conceale thoſe of the King.</hi> So that whereas Divines are permitted to dine as deepe as they can into Divine myſterys, as to thoſe of the King they are to remember, that <hi>Qui ſcrutator eſt Majeſtatis, opprimetur a gloriâ, He that pryes into
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:57387:66"/>Majeſty shall be oppreſt with glory</hi> Prou. 25.27. Death to the foole hardy.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The booke called <hi>Anti Haman</hi> p. 309. hath theſe words: <hi>There ſeemes to be as much difference, betwixt the ſpiritual food, which ſouls receiue in the</hi> Catholick Church, <hi>&amp; that of</hi> Proteſtants, <hi>as there</hi> is betwixt <hi>the nourriture a child receives ſucking a breaſt, ſtretched with milke, &amp; that he gets, by ſucking a moiſtned finger.</hi> We haue an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion here to ſee whither this judgment be well grounded.</p>
                     <p>Two things are remarkable in the inſtructions, which Miniſters giue to the ſouls vnder their direction, as appeares by their ſermons, &amp; ſpiritual bookes. 1. A horrour, &amp; hatred of <hi>Popery.</hi> 2. A ſlyght touch of ſome holeſome <hi>Catholick Truths,</hi> yet ſo handled, as not to moue conſiderably the ſoul, for feare it moue them too far. For example, they ſpeaking of ſome former ſins, the ſorrow for them, the purpoſe of amendment: the preventing God's judgments, by judging our ſelves, &amp; appeaſing his wrath by Penitencial workes, they do it well; yet knowing that thoſe points are meere <hi>Popery,</hi> to prevent their paſſing over to it they added an Antidote, which deſtroyes all they had ſayd. One inſtance shall ſuffice. Dr <hi>Hewit, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, &amp; Converſion</hi> p. 51. hath theſe words: <hi>we muſt confeſse to men, &amp; that both privately, &amp; publickly, according to the quality of the ſin,</hi> (This is catholick Doctrine: now he corrects it) <hi>For though we condemne</hi> Auricular Confeſſion, <hi>as a trick of ſtate Policy; yet we allow, &amp; exhort all Chriſtians to a tru, voluntary, &amp; ſincere Confeſſion of their ſins to the Bishop, &amp; ſuperintendents of the Church.</hi> Thus he. Now what is <hi>Private Confeſſion,</hi> but <hi>Auricular Confeſſion?</hi> Yet to the one he exhorts; the other he condemnes: or rather he approues, &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnes the ſame thing vnder different names. And what is this, but to build with one hand, &amp; pull downe with the other? to plant, &amp; roote vp, the ſame thing? To teach in Churchs, as tru <hi>Proteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant evidences</hi> depoſe in Courts plaine <hi>Downe ryght contradictions?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now what can a ſoul do, hearing this, if she be truly deſirous of ſalvation? Practice thoſe Truths? They bring her to <hi>Popery?</hi> Then they cannot ſeriouſly practice what you teach. This inward
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:57387:67"/>combate ſeldome ceaſes, till they leaue the <hi>Proteſtant Communion:</hi> for either they become immediatly <hi>Papiſts,</hi> if the loue of vertu o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercomes: or <hi>Presbiterians,</hi> if the hatred of <hi>Papiſts</hi> prevailes, by the helpe of a <hi>Moroſe nature.</hi> Thus the ſureſt tyes to <hi>Proteſtaney</hi> ſeeme to be, 1. a careleſſeneſſe of what is to come in the next world, 2. a Preſumption of God's goodneſſe, &amp; 3. Temporal motiues of all ſizes. All which are inſignificant to a ſoul, that prefers her eternal concerne, before her temporal, &amp; reſolues to advance in vertu an <hi>Earth,</hi> that shee may be more gratefull to her celeſtial ſpouſe in Heaven.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. For this reaſon the report of the change in <hi>Religion,</hi> of her R. H. eaſily found credit with me. Of which report, you ſpeake p. 4. &amp; 5. God had giuen her a ſerious deſire to ſerue him, as he would be ſerved. I heard she was earneſt in purſuing what she thought was for his glory, attentiue in her Devotions, &amp; exact in perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming what ſeemed to be the will of God, &amp; for the good of her ſoul: &amp; that though her Fortune was exceeding greate, yet she would rather forgoe it all, then hazard her ſoul: that Jewell being too precious, to be compenſated with any thing. God had <hi>Giuen her an extraordinary good vnderſtanding,</hi> ſay you p. 14. with which she could eaſily diſcerne betwixt what was <hi>Tru,</hi> &amp; what onely <hi>See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to be ſo.</hi> Whence without any helpe of Bookes, or inſtructions of men, by only Hearing the diſcourſe of <hi>Religion</hi> (which is the moſt common in <hi>England,</hi> &amp; will be ſo, till men talke themſelues either out of all <hi>Religion,</hi> or into a good one, either into <hi>Atheiſme,</hi> or <hi>Popery</hi>) she myght eaſily diſcover, that the devil was not ſo vgly, as he was painted: that ſomethings were charged on vs, which we did not hold: &amp; that what we really taught, was not Blame worthy: ſoe on both ſides we were jnnocent. And probably she myght declare ſo much, being vnwilling to heare vs wronged. Which gaue you occaſion to ſay, p. 4. that shee <hi>Declared in favour</hi> of <hi>Papiſts,</hi> &amp; grounded that Report, of her being one.</p>
                     <p>Then you ſpend ſeveral pages in proving how fatal a like Report
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:57387:67"/>had beene to her Father-in-law, K. <hi>Charles I.</hi> &amp; what prejudice it had like to haue done to <hi>Charles II.</hi> altho both were jnnocent of that Crime, &amp; averſe to the <hi>Religion.</hi> Which confirmes what I ſayd, how dangerous it is to entertaine that animoſity againſt <hi>Popery,</hi> which enables knaues to compaſſe the ruin of honeſt men, even the King himſelf, with only traducing him, or them, as <hi>Papiſts,</hi> how jnnocent ſoever they be, &amp; averſe to that Religion.</p>
                     <p>D. M. p. 12. <hi>It is Impoſſible to ſilence this Report</hi> (of your being a <hi>Papiſt</hi>) <hi>vnleſſe you your ſelf appeare in it, &amp; vpon all occaſions de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare your deteſtation of it.</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Rev. How inſignificant this remedy would haue proved, appeares by its ſucceſſe in the late King's time: Whoſe declarations of that nature, even at the <hi>Communion,</hi> could not ſilence his Enemyes, nor check a like report.</p>
                     <p>D. M. p. 15. <hi>None shall ever be able to proue, that either we omit any thing neceſſary to ſalvation: or teach any thing deſtructiue to it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Rev. Your <hi>Schiſme</hi> is deſtructiue to <hi>Salvation.</hi> It is vndeniable that <hi>Schiſmaticks</hi> remaming ſuch cannot beſaved; <hi>They shall not haue God for their father, who haue not the Church for their mother.</hi> S. Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian. And you are in a <hi>Schiſme.</hi> I myght alleadge ſeveral other things deſtructiue to <hi>Salvation:</hi> but this one is enough.</p>
                     <p>D. M. p. 17. &amp; 18. <hi>The Papiſts ſay there is no ſalvation, out of their Church. The</hi> Donatiſts <hi>ſayd ſo too. And was it not for that, ſaying ſo, that they were pronounced Hereticks?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Reviſor: Here are three groſſe miſtakes, of which I haue ſpoken ſec. 4. The 1. that the donatiſts ſayd there was no ſalvation out of their Church. Their grande errour was, that the Church was loſt by communicating with a ſinner. All their other errours were but ſequels of this: viz that there was no Church, but theirs, the reſt of the Chriſtians communicating with Cecilianus, who had delivered vp the holy bookes. 2. That there was no valid Baptiſme but in their Communion. 3. That the ſon, was leſſer than the father, &amp; the Holy ghoſt, than the ſon. See S. Auſtin l. de Hereticis ad
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:57387:68"/>
                        <hi>Quod vult Deum</hi> §. 69. &amp; Epi. Baronij ad annu Dom. 321. n. 4. For theſe errours the donatiſts were tru Herticks. But for ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that Hereſy deſtroys ſalvation, they could not be Hereticks, vnleſſe you will make S. <hi>Athanaſius</hi> one, who ſays in his creede: <hi>Quam,</hi> fidem, <hi>niſi quiſque integram inviolatamque ſervaverit, abſque dubio in aeternum peribit.</hi> No hopes of ſalvation, where any point of Faith is denyed.</p>
                     <p>The 2. <hi>That they were pronounced Hereticks for ſaying ſo.</hi> They were pronounced <hi>Hereticks</hi> for ſaying other things: as J haue shewne.</p>
                     <p>The 3. that they were held for <hi>Hereticks.</hi> The <hi>Catholick Church</hi> held them at firſt for <hi>Sciſmaticks,</hi> &amp; ſuch they were; but not for <hi>Hereticks.</hi> The <hi>Catholicks</hi> exacted nothing of them, but that they should joine Communion with them: they offred to that intent, that in thoſe cittyes, which had two <hi>Bishops,</hi> one of each Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, the ſurviver, which ſoever it was, should governe alone the <hi>Dioceſe,</hi> that by that meanes the <hi>Schiſme</hi> myght be extinguisht. A condition never offred to any <hi>Heretick,</hi> or <hi>Hereticks</hi> what ſoever. At laſt indeed they turned tru <hi>Hereticks,</hi> as I ſayd, on another ſcore.</p>
                     <p>D. M. p. 19. <hi>For you to conclude in favour of</hi> Popery, <hi>without hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring</hi> Proteſtants, <hi>is that which cannot be done either in</hi> Equity, or Conſcience.</p>
                     <p>Rev. She did not conclude for one ſide, without hearing the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, She had heard <hi>Proteſtants</hi> from her jnfancy, &amp; had weyghed maturely what they could ſay for themſelues, or againſt <hi>Popery.</hi> It is wonderfull, that a short Conference with ſome <hi>Papiſt,</hi> [it could be no more, if there were ſo much] should be of force ſufficient to roote vp all thoſe prejudices againſt God's <hi>Church,</hi> which you ſo carefull inſtill to thoſe vnder your conduct, althô they had bin confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by long practice, &amp; reiterated Acts contrary to the <hi>Catholick Faith:</hi> &amp; all theſe backed with almoſt the greateſt temporal inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt in the world: for on the one ſide, she ſaw honour, Riches, &amp; the probable expectation of our Imperial crowne; on the other, Reproaches, Calumnyes, diſgrace, &amp; probably a tragical End, for
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:57387:68"/>ſuch had been the fate of her Father-in-law indeed; &amp; what miſery, or vnjuſtice is ſo evident, ſo greate, as a <hi>Papiſt</hi> may not feare from a <hi>Tru Proteſtant?</hi> But <hi>Magna veritas, &amp; praevalet: Truth</hi> ſeconded by God's interiour grace, &amp; aſſiſted by her generous reſolution, never to admit the whole world into conſideration, when her ſoul was concerned, overcame all thoſe difficultyes. With this <hi>Truly Heroical</hi> reſolution you acquaint vs. For you ſay to her.</p>
                     <p>D. M. p. 21. <hi>You your ſelfe haue told me more then once, (even ſince this falſe report hath beene rayſed of you) that you would not do any thing, whereby you myght ſeeme to be of a</hi> Church, <hi>or</hi> Religion, <hi>which you are not of indeed; no not for any wordly conſideration whatſoever.</hi> And p. 22. <hi>you are wont to ſay, that no wordly either</hi> Advantage, <hi>or</hi> Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, <hi>is to be conſidered, when the gaining of the One, or the avoyding of the Other, comes into competition with the hazarding, or ſecuring of our ſpiritual, &amp; everlasting jntereſt of our ſouls: &amp; conſequently, that if you were convinced there were no</hi> Salvation <hi>to be had, but in the</hi> Church of Rome, <hi>no conſideration either of</hi> Loſſe, <hi>or of</hi> Danger <hi>here in this world, you myght incur by it, should keepe you from it.</hi>

                     <p>Rev. Out of theſe truly <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Reſolutions, often declared to you, I gather many material points, either vnknowne before, or not ſufficiently knowne.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That her R. H. was really enclined to be a <hi>Catholick.</hi> So that <hi>Report</hi> was grounded.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That you knew this inclination.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. That you endeavoured to divert her from it, alleadging cheifly temporal intereſt, to divert her from becoming a <hi>Papiſt.</hi> This J ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther out of thoſe declarations, which she ſo often made: &amp; out of this very letter, which containes little, if any thing at all elſe.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. That either you, which I do not beleiue, or ſome other <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant,</hi> adviſed her to diſſemble in matter of <hi>Religion,</hi> &amp; profeſſe her ſelf a <hi>Proteſtant,</hi> thô she were not ſo. What other occaſion could she haue to make that declaration, that <hi>She would not do any thing to ſeeme to be of a Church of which she was not,</hi> for all the world?</p>
                     <pb n="124" facs="tcp:57387:69"/>
                     <p>Laſtly, that she was too generous to be fryghted with ſuch Bug beares. When her ſoul lay at ſtake: knowing full well, it <hi>Would availe her nothing to gaine the whole world, if she loſt that.</hi> Mar. 8.36.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Thus this letter confirmes what was ſayd, but not commonly beleived, of the Religion in which her R. H. dyed, that she truly was a <hi>Catholick,</hi> or as you call vs, a <hi>Papiſt:</hi> for you owne her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination that way, &amp; you had little to alleadge to divert her from it, but temporal intereſt: which was as little able to retaine her, as a cobweb to hold a Lion: ſo it is impoſſible to miſſe in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture of the event.</p>
                     <p>But what judgment will the world make of your <hi>Church,</hi> out of this letter? The concerne you writ for, was as greate almoſt as could occurre, the retaining within your Communion a perſon, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable almoſt, as any whatſoever, a perſon worthily eſteemed as greate for her qualifications of mind, as to vertu, &amp; vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, as for her dignity in the Kingdome: a perſon, who was a greate ornament to your Church, nay a Piller of it. So no doubt but all induſtry was vſed to prevent her leaving you: &amp; that whatſoever your Art, your wit, &amp; learning could doe, was employed to that intent, &amp; we may gueſſe, that as the cauſe was common, ſo the concurrence was: &amp; therefore we may conjecture, that all the ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues of the <hi>Protestant Church</hi> joined to giue this Blow. Yet how weake, how inconſiderable is it!</p>
                     <p>And is then your <hi>Glorious Apoſtolical reformed Church come to this?</hi> Haue you no motiues, to commend her <hi>Communion,</hi> &amp; retaine pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſouls in it, but <hi>Temporal?</hi> will theſe weygh downe in the ſcales of reaſon all conſiderations of <hi>Eternity?</hi> And if they should be jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged weyght, by men, will God judge ſo too? At the greate day, will it be a ſufficient excuſe for <hi>Schiſme,</hi> &amp; <hi>Hereſy,</hi> to ſay: I was affrayd of looſing my eſtate, of hindring my fortune, of offending my freinds, of giving advantage to my Enemys? Will not <hi>Christ</hi> anſwer. Seing <hi>You haue diſowned me,</hi> &amp; my <hi>Church, before men, I will diſowne you before my father?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <pb n="125" facs="tcp:57387:69"/>
                     <p>I will not deny, but you haue given ſatisfaction, as to what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernes your ſelf, that you are a <hi>Proteſtant.</hi> Yet J muſt profeſſe, you giue little ſatisfaction, as to your <hi>Church.</hi> Nay I do declare, that I would never deſire other, nor better grounds to vindicate the Truth of <hi>Catholick Religion,</hi> &amp; the neceſſity of living in the <hi>Communion</hi> of the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> than what this letter affords. For by it, we may gather the condition of the <hi>Proteſtant Church</hi> to be like that of <hi>Laodicea,</hi> Apoc. 3.17. <hi>Wretched, &amp; miſerable, &amp; poore, &amp; blind, &amp; naked.</hi> I hartily wish you &amp; thoſe of your ranke, were truly ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of this Truth, &amp; that you made a ryght vſe of it, by ſeeking ways to returne to the Communion of the <hi>Catholick Roman Church:</hi> &amp; ſo put an end to this horrid <hi>Schiſme.</hi> Though the difficultyes to be overcome were greate, yet greate difficultyes ought not to fryght vs from ſo greate, ſo neceſſary a good, as that of the <hi>Peace</hi> of the <hi>Church.</hi> But in reality they are leſſe, then apprehended, which you muſt ſay, if you beleiue, what you report after <hi>Bishop Andrews,</hi> that the Pope was willing to confirme all, that Q. <hi>Elizabeth</hi> had done in matter of <hi>Religion,</hi> provided she would acknowledge his <hi>Supremacy.</hi> This is then the grand, nay the only obſtacle. Now all, who haue been converſant in Catholick countryes, &amp; ſee their cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes, even where that <hi>Supremacy</hi> is acknowledged, ſee cleerly, that this is no ſuch formidable thing, as to excuſe, &amp; juſtify a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration: &amp; by conſequence can be no juſt hindrance of <hi>Peace.</hi> which the <hi>God of Peace</hi> grant vs: &amp; giue all <hi>Schiſmaticks</hi> a tru deſire of. <hi>Amen.</hi>

                     <list>

                     </list>
                     <p>Which Propoſitions are built one vpon another, the third on the ſecond, &amp; this on the firſt. Which being <hi>Conditional;</hi> not <hi>Abſolute:</hi> ſuppoſing his <hi>Preſent perswaſion,</hi> we muſt ſee what that is: &amp; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this <hi>Meridian</hi> we muſt calculate his <hi>Duty.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>What this poore man's <hi>Perswaſion</hi> is, (if he haue any ſetled) is hard to judge of. He hath vowed <hi>Obedience</hi> to his <hi>Regular Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our;</hi> &amp; will not keepe it. He hath vowed <hi>Poverty,</hi> &amp; breakes that vow. He profeſſe the <hi>Catholick Faith,</hi> &amp; beleiues it full of <hi>Errors,</hi> nay <hi>Hereſyes.</hi> He ſays, he will remaine in the <hi>Communion</hi> of the <hi>Roman Catholick Church,</hi> &amp; yet beleiues her to be <hi>Heretick,</hi> &amp; <hi>Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick.</hi> He hath beene ordred backe to his <hi>Convent;</hi> &amp; he refuſes to returne: he hath been Canonically admonisht of his extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gances, &amp; he ſlights it: he hath been <hi>Excommunicated,</hi> &amp; he Laughs at it. In fine, in him <hi>Hereticks</hi> find a conſtant freind, <hi>Schiſmaticks</hi> a ſure Advocate, <hi>Apoſtates,</hi> a certaine Patrone, &amp; <hi>Catholicks</hi> an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placable Enemy; &amp; yet he pretends he is nether <hi>Heretick,</hi> nor <hi>Schiſmatick,</hi> nor <hi>Apoſtata;</hi> but a <hi>Catholick,</hi> &amp; member of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Church,</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Who can ſquare theſe circles, &amp; reconcile theſe <hi>Contradictions,</hi> betwixt his <hi>Declarations</hi> &amp; <hi>Actions,</hi> that ſo a judgment may be fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of his <hi>Tru Perſuaſion?</hi> Whither shall we giue credit to, his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations? Or his <hi>Actions?</hi> Thoſe ſpeake his being a <hi>Catholick,</hi> &amp; he is nothing leſſe. Theſe declare his hatred to <hi>Catholicks,</hi> &amp; their <hi>Religion,</hi> which yet he profeſſeth. So we muſt conclude him a <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mera,</hi> one compoſed of contradictions, &amp; his <hi>Religion</hi> is made vp of parts mutually deſtroying one another. Or elſe, that he hath no <hi>Religion:</hi> for as a <hi>Chimera</hi> cannot haue a being <hi>In rerum naturâ:</hi> ſo there can nether be an <hi>Entity</hi> compoſed of <hi>Contradictions,</hi> nor a <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi>
                        <pb n="127" facs="tcp:57387:70"/>for the ſame reaſon. At leaſt at the greate Audit, he can never fayle to heare <hi>Diſcede a me,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Begon from me:</hi> &amp; whither ſo ever Religion he be of, his owne words will condemne him: <hi>Ex ore tuo te judico, ſerve nequam.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>What can hence be gathered, but that his <hi>Perswaſion</hi> being ſo vncertain, &amp; his <hi>Religion</hi> ſo dubious, or certainly none at all, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be thence gathered, as to the <hi>Communion,</hi> which he should enter into. If you think him well diſpoſed for your <hi>Church,</hi> you diſcover what kind of men it is compoſed of. Ours, that is the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> doth not deſire ſuch, nor tolerate them, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than there is hopes of their amendment: &amp; little, or none at all being left of this man, she hath caſt him out by <hi>Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi> As I learne from your owne letter. So by what I ſee, I conclude that, <hi>You haue ſpoyled a Catholick, &amp; not made a Proteſtant.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Yet to moue him to come quite over, you very learnedly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguish three ages of the <hi>Church.</hi> The firſt, whileſt she continued in that <hi>Faith, which was once delivered to Saints.</hi> p. 31. The ſecond [p. 32.] from the time, the <hi>Pope tooke vpon him the title of</hi> vniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Bishop. Yet you are not reſolved what time to allow to this <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond age, whither one thouſand, or eleven, or</hi> twelue hundred yeares. The third, (p. 42.) from the two <hi>Councils,</hi> of <hi>Lateran</hi> vnder <hi>LEO X.</hi> &amp; <hi>Trent.</hi> jmplying, that all were bound to communicate with the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> in its firſt age, myght communicate with it, in the ſecond; &amp; muſt not in the third. Jn the firſt, Communion with it was a neceſſary duty: in the ſecond, it was lawfull, but not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary: in the third vnlawfull, &amp; a ſin. And theſe dreames take vp aboue 30. pages.</p>
                     <p>Rev. All this is a dreame: for the ſecond age, which you ſpeake of, is yet to come: the Pope never having taken the title of <hi>Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Bishop.</hi> Beſides this, <hi>Chriſt</hi> promiſt his aſſiſtance to the <hi>Church</hi> not for any determinate time; but for all times: &amp; aſſured her of his preſence, till the end of the world: now when you shall proue, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath broken, or can, or will, breake his word, we will
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:57387:71"/>think your ſecond age poſſible; not till then: ſo the firſt age, in which all are obliged to joine in Communion with the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> is not expired, nor will, nor can ever expire.</p>
                     <p>D. M. p. 62. <hi>Having quitted the Communion of the</hi> Roman Church, <hi>he is bound to joine with that of</hi> England, <hi>in</hi> Conſcience, it being the moſt perfectly <hi>reformed Church in the world: &amp; in</hi> Prudence, <hi>in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the protection of his Perſon &amp; proviſion for his future ſubſistance.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Rev. You boaſt much of the perfection of your Reformation: yet were never able to get it approved by any one externe <hi>Church,</hi> of what denomination ſoever: &amp; how many, or rather how few do vniverſally approue it in <hi>England,</hi> appeares by the number of your <hi>Sectaryes,</hi> &amp; <hi>Schiſmaticks.</hi> At what tribunal haue you not beene con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, whereever you appeared? The <hi>Pope</hi> hath anathematized your Reformation: ſo hath the <hi>General Council</hi> of <hi>Trent,</hi> that <hi>Church repreſentatiue.</hi> This Amphibium, this your Anonimous Preiſt, ſays you appealed to the <hi>Church diffuſiue:</hi> which he gathers by the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logyes</hi> you publisht for all men to ſee. But you haue had as ill ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe here, as at <hi>Trent,</hi> or <hi>Rome:</hi> having never been able to find any one Kingdome, or Province, or Citty, or any conſiderable number of particular men, who in all things approue your <hi>Reformation.</hi> So that you are in this inferiour to the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> to <hi>Calviniſts,</hi> to <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts,</hi> to <hi>Adamists,</hi> nay to <hi>Independents,</hi> &amp; <hi>Quakers,</hi> &amp;c. Who all haue in ſeveral countryes ſome of their Perſwaſion; but of yours none out of <hi>England:</hi> &amp; how many even there, owne their vocation to your <hi>Reformation</hi> more to the <hi>Royal Authority,</hi> than to the force of the <hi>Truth,</hi> you teach, or the Beauty of your <hi>Church,</hi> which you commend?</p>
                     <p>D. M. p. 63. <hi>Prudence</hi> obliges him to the ſame: for <hi>He can hardly be ſafe any where beyond ſeas: &amp; by joining with vs, he will: as alſo find proviſion for his ſubſiſtence: which</hi> you ſay <hi>you will vndertake shall not be wanting.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Rev. You ſow the fox's skin to that of a Lyon, &amp; <hi>Spiritual moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues</hi> falling short, you piece them out with <hi>Temporal.</hi> When we call
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:57387:71"/>to mind that within theſe fifty yeares your whole <hi>Church</hi> was tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned out of God's Bleſſing into the warme ſun, &amp; that within theſe fiue yeares she was very neere the ſame fate, we may conclude, that there is not much greater aſſurance of your <hi>Temporal,</hi> than of your <hi>Spiritual promiſes.</hi> Here I obſerue two things:</p>
                     <p>The firſt: that <hi>Temporal motiues</hi> are never omitted, when there is any hopes of gaining a <hi>Proſelit.</hi> Indeed they are your beſt Card, as appeares by your vſing it ſo frequently: &amp; by vſing it, you shew what weyght it hath with you.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond: that in this you differ very much from <hi>Papiſts,</hi> who propoſe hopes of eternal life, indeed; but as for this, they promiſe nothing but what <hi>Chriſt</hi> promiſt his <hi>Diſciples:</hi> 30.16.32. <hi>In mundo preſſuram habebitis: you shall be</hi> hated, calumniated, perſecuted, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned, <hi>Opprest,</hi> hanged, <hi>In this world:</hi> But better all this, than to looſe your ſoul, by <hi>Schiſme,</hi> &amp; <hi>Hereſy.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>D. M. p. 64. <hi>It remaines therefore,</hi> that being <hi>obliged to quit the</hi> Communion <hi>of the</hi> Church <hi>of</hi> Rome, <hi>&amp; joine with ours, of</hi> England, <hi>you are obliged to do this ſpeedily,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Rev. All this falls to the ground: for there nether is, nor can be an obligation to quit the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome;</hi> there being an obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation to conforme to her, to ſubmit to her deviſions in matter of Divine Truths, &amp; to renounce all errours, contrary to the tru Doctrine of Faith, which she teachs, &amp; will teach to the end of the world.</p>

                     <p>D. Morlaeus p. 16. <hi>Auguſtinum pro matre ſuâ Monicâ oravit quam ſalvam eſſe credidit: petiit, ut dimittantur ei debita, quae dimiſſa credebat.</hi> Quia ait: <hi>Credo quod jam feceris, quod te rogo; ſed voluntaria oris mei approba.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Reſp. Eccleſia nunquam oravit aut pro iis, quos certò credidit in caelo eſſe, quales 1. Martyres. 2. recens à Baptiſmo mortui: aut pro iis quos certò ſcit ex caelo in aeternum excluſos, quales non baptizati, &amp; qui ſunt in ſtatu peccati mortalis defuncti. Pro iis verò de quibus nihil certò conſtat, orat. quantacumque ſit pro alterutrâ parte proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitas, ob incertitudinem divinorum judiciorum, &amp; obſcuritatem in quâ verſamur. Multi enim videntur Sancti, qui meri ſunt Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pritae: aliarum pia vita in Chriſto abſcondita eſt. Itaque <hi>non ante tempus judicamus,</hi> quod admonet Apoſtolus; <hi>donec adveniat Dominus, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcondita
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:57387:89"/>tenebrarum illuminans, &amp; cordium conſilia revelans.</hi> Ad illud uſque tempus pro aliis timemus, de aliis benè ſperamus: de neutris judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cium ferimus, ob erroris periculum. Talis erat Auguſtini de Matris ſuae ſtatu ſpes metu mixta, quod indicant haec ejus verba: <hi>Quamquam illa in Chriſto vivificata ſic vixerit, ut laudetur nomen tuum in fide, moribuſque ejus; non tamen audeo dicere, ex quo eam per Baptiſmum regeneraſti, nullum ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bum exiiſſe de ore ejus contra praeceptum tuum: &amp; dictum eſt à veritate filio tuo: qui dixerit fratri ſuo, Fatue, reus erit gehennae ignis.</hi> Haec Auguſtinus l. IX. Conf. c. XIII. Quare benè ſperabat Auguſtinus de illius ſtatu, timebat tamen ne quid illicitum humana fragilitate perpetraſſet, pro quo non plene ſatisfeciſſet in vitâ. Hinc ut ſi quid eſſet ejusmodi Deus id miſericorditer condonaret, &amp; ipſe oravit, &amp; ut alii orarent enixè pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiit. Et hic eſt fidelium ſenſus in hunc uſque diem: quantacumque e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nim ſint pro felici ſtatu cujuſpiam argumenta, ſacrificia, aliaque ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fragia pro eo fiunt, donec per aliquam Eccleſiae declarationem (quam Canonizationem vocamus) conſtet eum beatitudine jam donatum eſſe: tunc enim ceſſant pro illo preces, &amp; in illius invocationem con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertuntur.</p>
                     <p>D. Morlaeus p. 17. <hi>Commemoratio defunctorum potiſſimùm fiebat, ut inde pateret. Tam vivos, quam mortuos ad idem Eccleſiae corpus pertinere, &amp; neminem unquam tam Sanctum fuiſſe, qui non hujus beneficio ſacrificii indigeret.</hi>

                     <p>D Morlaeus p. 20. <hi>Quicquid de Oratione pro mortuis ſenſerit Auguſtinus vel Ambroſius, non tamen inde ſequetur aut ipſum, aut ullum alium ex reliquis, Invocationi Sanctorum patrocinatum eſſe. Nam invocatio Sancto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum cum oratione pro mortuis nihil habet commune. Et praeterea haec eſt aliquo modo licita; illa toto genere illicita: haec inutilis, &amp; ſuperſtitioſa; illa idolatri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca, &amp; in Deum, &amp; Chriſtum contumelioſa.</hi>
                     </p>

Si ſolis cenſuris pugnandum eſſet, &amp; viciſſe credendi fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, qui acerbiores proferrent, etſi omni ratione deſtitutas, rixoſis mulierculis, petulantibus Adoleſcentibus, atque moroſis ſenibus, tutius committeretur diſputatio Theologica, quam viris in eâ Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium, ſcientiarumque Reginâ peritis: Xantippe ſocrati praeſtaret, Zoilus Homero, Semei Davidi, &amp; pueri Bethelitae, Elizaeo. Sed abſit tam abjectè de hominum genere, de Chriſtianis ſentiamus, ut cenſeamus eos adverſus immoderatas iſtiusmodi exaeſtuantis bilis redundantias armandos eſſe; quibus nunquam froena laxantur donec ratio praevalet, quâ deficiente recurritur ad ea dicteria, ut clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus deficientibus tibiis ad equum.

Quam iniquae porrò ſintiſtae cenſurae, poſtea patebit. Illud tantum hic ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervo, minus conſideratè à te dici, nihil commune eſſe Sanctorum invocationi, &amp; orationi pro mortuis, Contrarium aſſerueras ſupra, ubi dixiſti fideles iis modis ſuam communionem cum Animabus tum Beatis in caelo, tum in abditis receptaculis ſuam beatitudinem

                     <p>PRobatur 1, ex Geneſeos XLVIII. <hi>Angelus qui eruit me de cunctis malis,</hi> ait Jacobus, <hi>benedicat pueris iſtis; &amp; invocetur ſuper eos nomen meum, nomina quoque Patrum meorum Abraham, &amp; Iſaac.</hi> Apertam hic habemus Angeli invocationem, noſtrae ſimilem id eſt relativam, &amp; tranſitivam.

                        </expan> ſuorum nomen ab aliis invocandum.</p>
                     <p>Prob. 2. Moyſes ipſe Sanctos Invocavit: Exodi XXXII. 13. <hi>Recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dare Domine Abrahaam, &amp; Iſaac, &amp; Iſrael, ſervorum tuorum.</hi> Quibus ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis eos velut mediatores, aut interceſſores adhibuit. Et frequentiſſimae fuerunt iſtorum trium invocationes ex eo tempore, qui videntur quaſi populi Iſraelitici tutelares, ſive Patroni. Factâ vero decem tribuum à Judâ ſeceſſione, tribus iſta Davidem invocavit ſimili modo, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter cujus merita diu ſtetit &amp; regia civitas, &amp; ipſum Regnum, quod a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lioquin fuiſſet ob gravia populi Regumque illius peccata delendum.</p>
                     <p>Prob. 3. Sancti poſt hanc vitam orant pro nobis. Petrus in poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riori ſua Epiſt. 1.15. <hi>Dabo operam &amp; frequenter habere vos poſt obitum meum, ut borum memoriam faciatis.</hi> Quod idem eſt, ac polliceri ſe pro eorum pia vitâ poſt mortem oraturum. Praeterea 11. Mach. XV. 14. Hieremias dicitur multum orare pro populo Iſrael. Ibidem de Oniâ idem dicitur. Hieremiam gladium Iudae Iudaeorum Duci dediſſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fertur, quo populi ſui hoſtes debellaret. Reſpondent 1. libros illos Canonicos non eſſe: Verum hoc non ſatisfacit 1. Quia Eccleſia pro Canonicis jam Auguſtini tempore agnovit. 2. Quia ſaltem continent
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:57387:92"/>veram hiſtoriam quod ad praeſens inſtitutum ſufficit. Reſpondent. 2. ſomnium fuiſſe. Fateor; ſed ſomnium à Deo immiſſum &amp; veram rerum futurarum revelationem in eo factam ſubſecuta victoria demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtravit.</p>
                     <p>Prob. 4. Hieremiae XV. 1. negat Deus ſe Moyſen, &amp; Samuelem ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>auditurum, ſi pro populo intercederent &amp; Ezech. XIV. 20. Simile quid de Noe, Daniele, &amp; Iobo dicitur: eo quod planè conſtituiſſet contu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macem illam gentem poenis domare, ad quam converten dam fruſtra fuiſſent admonitiones minaeque adhibitae. Nec ullorum precibus ſe ab inſtituto dimoveri permiſſurus eſſet. Quorſum iſta, niſi Deus San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorum interceſſione ſubinde placaretur, &amp; id populo illi tum tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris eſſet perſuaſum? Hoc etiam notatu dignum, quod cùm Chriſtum in cruce pendentem Eliam invocaſſe dixiſſent ex adſtantibus aliqui, (Matth. XXVII.) nemo ex Phariſaeis, (qui in omnes ei calumnias ſtruen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di occaſiones imminebant) eum propterea accuſavit, quod haud o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſiſſent, ſi quod Calvini grex ſentit, ſine Idololatriâ Sancti non in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocantur.</p>
                     <p>Prob. 5. Sancti in hac vitâ &amp; licitè &amp; utiliter invocantur. Ergo &amp; poſt hanc vitam. 1. Reg. VII. 8. ad Samuelem ait populus Iſraeliticus: <hi>ne ceſſes pro nobis clamare ad Dominum Deum noſtrum, ut ſalvet nos de manu Philiſtinorum.</hi> Iob. XLII. 8. <hi>Ite ad ſervum meum Iob, Iob autem ſervus meus o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabit pro vobis, faciem ejus ſuſcipiam, ut non vobis imputetur ſtultitia.</hi> q. d. Interceſſorem adhibete Iobum, ipſius pro vobis preces exaudiam, &amp; quam meriti eſtis poenam remittam. Et in novo inſtrumento: Rom. XV. 30. <hi>Obſecro vos fratres per D. N. I. C. &amp; per charitatem Sancti Spiritus, ut adjuvetis me in orationibus veſtris pro me ad Deum, ut liberer ab infidelibus, qui ſunt in Iudaeâ.</hi> Similis Sanctorum vivorum invocatio habetur Epheſ. VI. 18.19. &amp; Coloſ. IV. 3. &amp; 1. Theſſal. V. 25. &amp; 1.25, &amp; 11. Theſſal. 111.1. &amp; Philip. 24. &amp; Heb. XIII. 18. &amp; Iac, v. 18. <hi>Orate pro inimicem, ut ſalvemini.</hi> Quare ſalvà fide de Antecedenti dubitari non poteſt. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequentia manifeſta eſt: quia Sancti mortui non minus nos amant, quam vivi, ut pro nobis intercedere velint, nec minus Deo grati ſunt, ut poſſint, quae nobis uſui ſunt impetrare. Cur ergo non licebit
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:57387:93"/>eos invocare, aequè ac illos? Hoe argumento uſi ſunt ad idem pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandum Hieronymus, Auguſtinus, Chryſoſtomus, aliique infra ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tandi. Dixit aliquis Sanctos in hac vitâ invocari poſſe, quia ſunt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſti membra, eorumque preces hujus meritis innituntur: quaſi haec in Sanctos etia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> mortuos non competant, aut deſinerent eſſe Chriſti mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bra, cum ipſi arctiſſimo, &amp; indiſſolubili vinculo nectuntur, aut hujus meritis minus niterentur, quando ſunt ei arctius conjuncti, &amp; majora eorum virtute praemia ſunt conſecuti.</p>

Elias hinc raptus, quae impius Joram Rex Juda contra Dei legem moliebatur, optimè novit eumque per epiſtolas comminatorias conatus eſt ad meliorem frugem reducere. 11. Paralip. XXI 12. De quo vide Cornelium à Lapide ad illum locum, &amp; Salianum, qui putat IX circiter annis ab Eliae raptu miſſas fuiſſe illas Epiſtolas. Deinde ex laudato 11. Mach.

                     <p>Ex novo Teſtamento clarius apparet id, quod cum Eccleſiâ aſſero. Luc. XIV. Dives epulo ſepultus in Inferno, ſciebat ſuperſtites eſſe ip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius quinque fratres, eoſque tam perditè vivere, ut in ſummo eſſent damnationis periculo. Hoc ſciebat &amp; Abraham, &amp; inſuper eos habere Moyſen, &amp; Prophetas, hoc eſt eorum libros, quibus ad curandam ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutem aeternam, quantum ſat eſſet, admonebantur. Ex quibus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtat Animas corpore ſolutas, ſive quae in refrigerio erant in Abrahae ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nu, ſive quae torquebantur in Inferno, quae hic agebantur cognoviſſe. Quo jure Beatas in caelo animas eâ cognitione privas, quam Chriſtus Dominus animabus tum in limbo Patrum degentibus tum damnatis adſcribit? Deinde idem Chriſtus Dominus Luc. XV. 10 dicit: <hi>Gaudium eſſe in caelo ſuper uno peccatore poenitentiam agente.</hi> Sciunt ergo Beati quod Peccator aliquis Poenitentiam agit, nec enim de repenitus ignotâ gaudere poſſunt: de ignoto enim objecto nec gaudium eſſe poteſt, ſi bonum eſt, neque triſtitia, ſi malum.</p>
                     <p>Accedit &amp; ratio: nam ad ipſorum Beatitatem ſpectare videtur, quod omne honeſtum ipſorum deſiderium impleatur. Honeſtè au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem deſiderare poſſunt ea ſcire quae vel agunt, vel patiuntur primò ipſorum Parentes, filii, conſanguinei, 2. illi, quarum curam in terrâ

Hinc Abraham, Iſaac &amp; Jacob avere poſſunt, ſcire, quae populo Iſraelitico eveniunt: David, Ludovicus, Henricus, Odoardus, quae ipſorum reg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis, Petrus, Pauluſque quae toti Eccleſiae, Antonius, Benedictus, Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſcus, Ignatius, quae cujuſque Inſtituti Profeſſoribus: Felix, quae No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lae.

                     <p>A ſanctis Patribus longè amplior Beatis animabus cognitio tribui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur. Auguſtinus enim Tract. CI. in Joan. ſub finem ait: <hi>Modicum &amp; videbimus eum, ubi jam nihil rogemus, nihil interrogemus: quia nihil deſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>randum remanebit, nihil quaerendum latebit.</hi> Et Gregorius l. IV, Dialog. C. XXXIII. <hi>Quid eſt quod neſciant, qui ſcientem omnia ſciunt?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Quod ad modum, five medium ſpectat, in quo, vel per quod iſta intelligunt, quandoquidem illud Deus nec in verbo ſcripto, nec in non ſcriptis Traditionibus declarare dignatus ſit, nec Eccleſia quid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam definivit, ego libenter ignorantiam meam agnoſco. Poſſunt iſta cognoſcere per eos, qui hinc morrendo pergunt: poſſunt etiam per Angelos ea nuntiari. Poſſunt etiam Deo revelante ſcire: qui tres modi ab Auguſtino proponuntur 1. de cura pro mortuis C XV. Poſtre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus modus placere videtur Gregorio ſupra laudato: &amp; clare Aſſeritur à Concilio Senonenſi Decreto XIII, quod cum retuliſſet aliquos ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gare, Sanctos preces noſtras audire, ait: <hi>Hoc quam ſit non modo veritati; ſed Scripturis quoque diſſonum facilè intelligit, qui Bratis pervium eſſe non ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norat omniforme illud Divinitatis Speculum, in quo quidquid eorum interſit, innoteſcat.</hi> Et B. Auguſtinus hac ratione res creatas intelligi ab Ange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis inſinuat, dum eorum cognitionem Matutinam eam eſſe dicit, quâ res in verbo cognoſcunt. Portò dici poteſt haud ineptè Divina Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentia ob eam virtutem res repraeſentandi <hi>Speculum Voluntarium; Specu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum,</hi>
                        <pb n="38" facs="tcp:57387:95"/>quia res repraeſentat: <hi>voluntarium,</hi> quia ſolum ea repraeſentat, quae Beatorum intereſt cognoſcere, ſive quae ad eorum ſtatum perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, &amp; quae Deus ab iis cognoſci vult.</p>
                     <p>Denique illa ſcire poſſunt per vim innatam intellectui ipſorum. Hic quidem in corpore ratione ſenſuum à quibus in operando de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendet: ad certam activitatis ſphaeram reſtringitur: at ubi corpore ſolutus eſt, &amp; à ſenſuum cooperatione liber, non alios limites no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vit, quam qui res omnes exiſtentes complectatur. Sicut ergo nos per Epiſtolas res in altero hemiſpherio geſtas, &amp; per hiſtorias res ante multa ſaecula praeteritas, cognoſcimus nihil obſtante aut loci, aut temporis diſtantiâ; ita intellectus Beatus vi ſuâ innatâ. Hoc, ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſito, animas tantum à nobis diſtare, quantum à ſupremo caelo terra: licet incomperta nobis ſit illarum à nobis diſtantia.

                     <p>Nec hujus teſtimonii vigori quidquam detrahit Auguſtini dubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatio, de verâ ratione, quâ nitebatur iſta praxis, aut utilitate inde ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nante. Fusè probat Chriſtianos ſolicitos eſſe non debere de ſepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chro, ob Chriſti verba: <hi>Nolite timere eos qui occidunt corpus, &amp; poſt hoc non habent amplius quod faciant:</hi> ut eos conſolaretur, quorum amici, aſſines, &amp; conſanguinei in clade Romanâ occiſi fuerant, eorumque corpora inſepulta Avibus caeli, &amp; beſtiis terrae laceranda relicta ſunt. Cumque totam ejus mentem ocuparet (dum librum iſtum ſcriberet) conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lationis illis impertiendae deſiderium, vix tenui rimâ claram lucem admiſit ex Eccleſiae praxi derivatam, quam &amp; averè diſtribuit, ne af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictos affligeret, de ſepulchri alieni jacturâ maeſtos, de ſuo ſolicitos.

                     <p>Quod ergo Auguſtinus praxim illam fidelium referat, cum Pauli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no, eamque verbis &amp; à Bellarmino, &amp; à me prolatis approbat, id ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſlae rei veritati tribuendum: quod verò in dandâ hujus praxeos ratione, fructuque explicando, quem inde adipiſcerentur fideles, mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus ſirmus videatur, neque totis ingenii ſui viribus praxim illam commendat, id dandum puto fidelium dolori, à Romanâ clade, &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſepultis cadaveribus orto.

                        <hi>SECTIO XI.</hi> Rationibus Theologicis probatur Sanctorum Invocatio.</head>
                     <p>PRima ducitur ex Liturgiis, quarum nulla eſt, quae non aliquam Sanctorum Invocationem, potiſſimùm B. Mariae Deiparae Virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis. Eruditiſſimus P. Natalis Alexande dubitat an aliquae Liturgiae corum ſint, quorum nomina praeferunt, eo quod voces aliquas conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neant, quas poſteriora ſaecula invexerunt. At argumentum inefficax eſt: quia Liturgiae cum ſint publici juris, &amp; non tam ab aliquo homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne, ut talis eſt, quam ab eo, ut Epiſcopus, eſt, proficiſcantur, ſintque potius partes Auctoritatis, quam ingenii. Inde fit, ut datâ occaſione jure ſuo uſi fint, primi Auctoris ſucceſſores ad eas augendas, &amp; locu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletandas: non tamen novarum acceſſione partium; ſed priorum partium incremento: ad eum modum, quo corpus humanum auge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur: in quo ab ipſis initiis caput, manus pedes, item cor, cerebrum, il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la, eadem, quae novae materiae acceſſione, &amp; proportionata adjectione creſcit in menſuram virilem.</p>
                     <p>Partes verò Liturgiarum eſſentiales &amp; primigeniae ſunt 1. quae ad Symbolorum Conſecrationem in Dei honorem &amp; Paſſionis Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cae memoriam ſpectant. 2. Oratio vel Invocatio Sanctorum. 3. Oratio pro defunctis in his enim omnes omnino Liturgiae conveniunt.</p>
                     <p>Probatur 2. ex eo quod nunquam altare conſtitutum fuerit, ſine Martyrum Reliquiis. Et Eccleſiae ipſae <hi>Memoriae Martyrum</hi> dictae ſunt. Hinc conſtat magnum honorem illis exhibitum: quem etiam exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet hodieque Eccleſia Romana, Graeca, aliae; ſola Proteſtantica ut ab Eccleſiis hujus temporis, ita ab omnibus Antiquis differret, ab om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium aequè pietate, &amp; Sanctitate, ac à moribus, &amp; praxi defecit.</p>
                     <p>Prob. 3. Quia Pagani, cum à Chriſtianis impugnarentur ob hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:57387:99"/>divinos hom inibus mortuis exhibitos, reſponderunt ipſoſmet Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianos ſimilem cultum mortuis exhibere, Martyres honorando.</p>
                     <p>Prob. 4. quia Chriſtiani Ethnicis reſpondentes agnoſcunt ſe Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyres colere, eorumque ſepulchra venerari eos invocare; ſed non ut Deos; ſed ut Dei famulos, Deo gratos, apud eum potentes, quorum preibus ſe juvari apud eundem Deum ſperabant. Hujus rei teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia infra producentur.</p>
                     <p>Prob. 5. Patres, qui de Invocatione Sanctorum locuti ſunt, non ut de re nova; ſed ut de antiquitùs uſurpata loquuntur. Nec ullum è ſanctis Patribus invenire eſt, qui eam novam dixcrit eſſe, prioribus ignotam, ſuo, aut ullo alio Apoſtolis poſteriori tempore inventam. Quod evidenter probat, Euangelio coaevam eſſe Martyres invocandi conſuetudinem.</p>
                     <p>Prob. denique 6. quia qui Martyres invocandos negarunt, Vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantius, &amp; alii, velut Haeretici condemnati ſunt ab Eccleſiâ. Quod pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tet ex Epiphanio, Auguſtino, atque Hieronymo.

Ante Saturnum Deus penes vos nemo eſt: ab illo cenſus totius vel potioris, vel notioris Divinitatis. Itaque quod de Origine conſtiterit, id de poſteritate conveniet.

                     <p>Quod in hac Sectione contendimus, Auguſtinus triplici argumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to probat, ſcilicet, malos Daemones fuiſſe quos Ethnici coluerunt ut Deos. Primum habetur lib. I. de conſenſu Evang. ca. XXV. Gentilium Deus non prohibebat ullum aliu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Deum coli, praeter verum Deum; &amp; verus Deus eos omnes adorari vetuit. <hi>Iupiter</hi> ait Auguſtin. <hi>non prohibet Saturnum coli, quem regno exuerat, nec Saturnus Iovem.

<pb n="88" facs="tcp:57387:120"/>perturbat Deus Iſrael. Qui cum illos omnes coli vetuerit,... eorumque ſimula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chris, &amp; ſacris, everſionem praeceperit, praedixerit, &amp; ſecerit, ſatis oſtendit illos falſos atque fallaces, &amp; ſe eſſe verum, ac ver acem Deum.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secundum ejuſdem argumentum habetur l. II. de Civ. Dei c. IV. ubi cum retuliſſet obſcaena Carmina quae in honorem Matris Deo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum cantari ſolebant, qualia nemo mentis compos coram Matre ſuâ proferret: addit: <hi>Quae ſunt ſacrilegia, ſi iſta ſunt ſaecra? aut quae inquinatio, ſi illa lavatio? &amp; hac fercula appellabantur, quaſi celebraretur convivium, quo velut ſuis epulis immunda daemonia paſcerentur. Quis enim non ſentiat, cujuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modi ſpiritus talibus obſcaenitatibus delectentur: niſi vel neſciens utrum omnino ſint ulli immundi ſpiritus, Deorum nomine decipientes, vel talem agens vitam, in quâ iſtos potius quam Deum verum, &amp; optet propitios, &amp; formidet iratos?</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inde c.

                     <p>Denique l. X. operis mox laudati, cap. XVI, probat eos nullo modo bonos ſpiritus eſſe poſſe, qui divinos honores ſibi exhiberi curabant, &amp; à veri Dei cultu, imò &amp; cognitione homines, quantum fieri pote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat, abducebant. Hoc autem fecerunt illi nequam ſpiritus. Quo ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gumento uſus eſt etiam eſt Cyrillus l. IV. cont. Jul. p. CXXXI. <hi>Homines abduxerunt,</hi> inquit, <hi>ne omnino cognoſcerent, quis naturâ, ac verè univerſorum opifex ſit, ac Dominus: ſibi autem honores arripiunt ab Omnibus, ſacrificia, fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtos dies, hominibuſque perſuaſerunt, ut ipſorum cultui tantum incumberent.</hi> Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectus apparuit in Iſraëlitis qui Judic.

                     <p>CAlvinus l. I. Inſtit. C. XI. S. VIII, aſſeverat <hi>omnibus ferè à mundo condito ſaeculis</hi> Idololatriam extitiſſe. Vnde ſequitur eam fere fuiſſe mundo coaevam. Caeterùm nec ullâ ratione confirmat hanc ſuam aſſertionem, nec ullum Auctorem laudat, unde ea deſumatur. Hinc nihil mirum ſi fidem ei denegemus.</p>
                     <p>Rabbi Maimonides ait incepiſſe ab Enos, Sethi filio, Adami nepo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te: cujus tempore ait <hi>homines erraſſe, &amp; inter errantes fuiſſe Enos.</hi> Quod probare conatur ex Gen. C. IV. 26. Caeterùm Enos ab eo crimine im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munem arbitror: quia loco laudato vulgata dicit: <hi>Iſte capit invacare nomen Domini.</hi> Et reliquae verſiones omnes in Enoſi laudem, potiùs quàm vituperium illa verba ſumunt. Solum Targum Onkelos pecca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum aliquod inſinuat: quod tamen potius in Enoſi poſteris, quam in ipſo reſediſſe indicat. Vnde R.

                        </gap>. Quae verba ſi ad perſonam ejus referas, ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum reddunt a Bellarmino traditum, Enos nempe caeteris religioſiùs coluiſſe Deum, &amp; quaſi Religioſam vitam obſervaſſe. Si verò referas ad homines eo tempore viventes, ſignificant eos vel ſtatis diebus ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litos fetiari, ut uni Deo vacarent: aut etiam certis cujuſtibet diei ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris, circa Auroram, meridiem, aut veſpertina crepuſcula, aut etiam quando praecipua opera aggrediebantur, v.c. cibum ſumebant, dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitum ibant, è ſtrato ſurgebant, &amp;c. Perpetuus enim omnium homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num bonorum mos eſt, ſemperque fuit, illiuſmodi opera à Dei invoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione auſpicari. Aliqui ergo per verba illa intelligunt publicas homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num Enoſi tempore viventium preces: Bellarminus privatam illius pietatem. Utrique probabilitèr; Nicolaus Liranus, Bellarmino ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fragatur, cùm ait: <hi>Enos inſtructum à Patre ſuo juſto, tantum profeciſſe in cultu divino, ut adinvenerit verba quaedam devota, ad deprecandum Deum.</hi> Haec ille: quae tamen cautè legenda, &amp; cum grano ſalis explicanda ſunt: quatenus vim quamdam aliquibus verbis ineſſe innuit ad pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>candum Deum. Quod Magicum quid ſonat.</p>
                     <p>Nobiſcum Patres ſentiunt, quia docent ante diluvium nuſquam fuiſſe Idololatras. Tertul. l. de Idololatriâ, ait Enoch (quem Judas in ſuâ Canonicâ <hi>ſeptimum ab Adamo</hi> vocat, &amp; diu poſt Enos vixit) praedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xiſſe, &amp; praedamnaſſe Idololatriam longè poſt extituram. Quare ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tit necdum notam fuiſſe Enochi tempore. Idem ſentit Cyrillus l. I. cont. Julianum: Idque colligit, ex eo quod Idololatriam ante Dilu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vium nullus idoneus Auctor aſſerit extitiſſe. Nec etiam ante Turris famoſae aediſicationem, eamdem ob cauſam. At verò pauloò poſt ea ſemina jacta ſunt, quae copioſam malorum meſſem protulerunt. Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium mali à <hi>Saruch,</hi> qui fuit Abrahae Proavus, ſi fides Suidae, qui tradit eum, Polytheiſmum, &amp; Idololatriam in mundum invexiſſe: cui ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribere malim, quam Conſtantino Manaſſi hoc non ipſi Sanuch; ſed ejus poſteris attribuenti. Enimverò Judith v. 8. refert Achior, Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hamum <hi>deſeruiſſe ceremonias Patrum ſuorum, quae in multitudine Deorum
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:57387:138"/>erant, &amp; unum Deum colere caepiſſe.</hi> Plures ergo majores Abrahae, &amp; non eorum aliquis unus fuerunt Idololatrae, tres ſcilicet aut ad minimum duo. Cum ergo Saruch inter, &amp; Abraham, duo tantum interceſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rint, <hi>Nachor,</hi> &amp; <hi>Thare,</hi> hic Abrahae Pater, alter Sarugi filius (ut colli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitur ex Luc. III. 34.35.) ſequitur Sarug illâ voce plurali fuiſſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſum. Confirmatur, quia Aug. l. XVI. de Civ. Dei C. XII. docet <hi>Thare</hi> fuiſſe pium, &amp; unius Dei veri cultorem. De quo vide Salianum ad annum Mundi bis milleſimum.</p>
                     <p>Cum verò duplicem errorem erratint Idololatrae, Idola colendo, &amp; etiam multos Deos, quaeri poteſt, uter error fuerit antiquior? Reſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deo: antiquior videtur Polytheiſmus: atque primùm omnium ſtellas &amp; admirationi fuiſſe propter pulchritudinem, &amp; venerationi, propter utilitatem. Hinc Sap. XIII. primò refertur, &amp; refutatur Aſtrorum Adoratio: deinde Idolorum. Idem ſentit R. Maimonides, &amp; Diodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus Siculus l. I. Bibliothecae. Germanos non alios Deos agnoviſſe, quam Solem, Lunam, &amp; Vulcanum, teſtis eſt Caeſar.</p>
                     <p>Lucianus lib. de Deâ Syriâ ait Aegyptios omnium Gentium primos fortaſsè Deorum habuiſſe notitiam, iis templa ſtatuiſſe, lucos conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craſſe, &amp; ſolemnes indixiſſe conventus. Quae ſi vera ſint, falſi fue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt; qui vel Sarug, vel Ninum primum Idololatram, Belum verò pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mam perſonam Deificatam aſſeruerunt. Caeterùm tota difficultas ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitur, dicendo, Graecum fuiſſe Lucianum: ac proindè totam ſuam doctrinam ab Aegyptiis accepiſſe: à quibus, teſte Diodoro Siculo, ſuos Graeci Deos acceperunt. Vnde nihil mirum ipſos de antiquio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribus Diis non cogitaſſe, quorum nulla in Aegyptiorum Menologio mentio. Sed de his ſatis.</p>

                        <hi>SECTIO XXIV.</hi> Quae fuerint occaſiones Idola faciendi?</head>
                     <p>TRes fuiſſe Idola faciendi occaſiones, antiquorum teſtimonia probant, quae ſunt. 1. Luctus ob aliquem Charum ereptum. 2. Honor abſenti deferendus. 3. Gratus in benè meritum animus. Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gula probemus.</p>
                     <p>Prima cauſa traditur Sap. XIV. 15. <hi>Acerbo luctu dolens Pater, citò ſibi rapti ſilii</hi> (vel <hi>Patris,</hi> addit Salianus) <hi>fecit imaginem &amp; illum, qui tunc quaſi homo mortuus fuerat, nunc tanquam Deum colere caepit: &amp; conſtituit inter ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vos ſuos ſacra, &amp; ſacrificia.</hi> Infra S. XXIX. dicemus quomodo hoc maeſti Patris qualequale ſolatium innocens, in omnium criminum maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum degenerarit.</p>
                     <p>Dicit quidem Patrem ſuperſtitem <hi>erepti ſibi filii imaginem feciſſe:</hi> non negat autem filios Patribus ſuis ſimilem honorem procuraſſe. Sic Belum coli cura vit Ninus ejus ſilius, &amp; ditionum haeres. Idem de Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rug dicendum, eum Patri ſuo ſtatuam erexiſſe, ſi vera ſit Rabbinorum ſententia, dicentium, Aran omnium primum ante Patrem ſuum ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iiſſe: quod colligunt ex illis ſacrae Scripturae verbis Gen. XI. 28. <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuuſque eſt Aran ante Thare Patrem ſuum:</hi> Quod fruſtra fuiſſet annotatum, ſi quod modo paſſim ſit, etiam tunc fieret, ut Patres frequenter filio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum funera ducerent. (Quod intelligi debet, de filiis ante Patres ſuos morte naturali defunctis: nam ſi ſermo ſit de iis etiam qui violen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tâ morte ſublari ſunt anre Patres ſuos, conſtat Aran non fuiſſe pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum; ſed Abel (qui ab homicidâ Cain occiſus eſt) unde ſequitur Sarug Patri ſuo Idolum ſtatuiſſe, quia nullum filium amiſit ipſe: nam Aran Abrahae frater poſt mortem Sarug vivere deſiiſſe videtur: quia dicit Scriptura ipſum ante Thare Patrem ſuum mortuum eſſe; non verò ante Proavum Sarug. Idem fecit Ninus Patri ſuo Bel, &amp; ſine du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bio varii alii fecerunt. Videatur Epiphanius Epiſt. ad Acatium, &amp; Paulum, qui diſertè dicit filios Parentibus ſuis Idola ſtatuiſſe.</p>
                     <pb n="124" facs="tcp:57387:139"/>
                     <p>Cur ergo Patris in filium impiam illam pietatem nominat hic ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piens, potiuſquam Filii in Patrem? Reſpondeo, quia amor deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, &amp; teneriot eſt Patris in filium &amp; Magiſtri in Diſcipulum affectus, quàm ècontra. Vnde Patres filiorum ſuorum mortem veris lacry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis ferè ſemper lugent; non item filii Patrum: cum exempla non de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſint eorum, qui ante diem Patrios inquiſierint in annos, ut eorum ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>irent haereditatem.</p>
                     <p>Sic ergo Parentes filiis, filii Parentibus primùm ſepulchra cura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt, eorum ſtatuis ornata: his deinde ſuperaedificarunt Templa: de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nique ſacra &amp; ſacrificia conſtituerunt. Quae fuit prima &amp; maximè communis Idolorum conſtituendorum cauſa, adeò ut à Patribus ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inde ſola nominetur, quaſi unica eſſet. Minutius Felix: <hi>Sacra facta ſunt, quae fuerant aſſumpta ſolatia.</hi> Et Hieronymus l. 1. Comment. in c. 41. Oſeae: <hi>Omnia Idola ex mortuorum errore creverunt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Altera cauſa fuit Reverentia Regibus debita, &amp; obedientiae futurae ſtipulatio, quam poſteriora ſaecula barbarâ voce, <hi>Homagium</hi> appellant. Sap. XIV. 16. <hi>Interveniente tempore, convaleſcente iniquâ conſuetudine, hic error tanquam Lex cuſtoditus eſt, &amp; Tyrannorum imperio colebantur figmenta. Et hos, quos in palam homines honorare non poterant, propter hoc, quod longè eſſent, è longinquo figura eorum allata, evidenter Imaginem Regis, quem hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rare volebant, fecerunt; ut illum, qui aberat, tanquam praeſentem colerent ſuâ ſolicitudine.</hi> Horum Regum ſtatuis initio ſolus civilis cultus exhibitus eſt; qui poſtmodum in ſacrum tranſiit: &amp; licet ex primâ intentione ad ſupplendum tantummodo praeſentiam inſtitutus fuerit, tamen et<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iam praeſentibus erectae ſubinde ſtatuae. Quod Nabuchodonoſori fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum. Viſum etiam id Regibus magis honorificum, dum non ipſi ſolum; verum etiam Imagines, ſtatuae, ſigilla, veſtes, denique quid-quid ad eos ſpectaret peculiari modo, honoraretur. Hinc Imperato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum Romanorum erecta ſigna, ſtatuae inſuper, venerationi militum expoſitae, quoties eis dona diſtribuebantur.</p>
                     <p>Civilem illum Imaginum cultum ab alio ſacro &amp; ſeparabilem eſſe, &amp; defacto ſeparatum, liquet, quia Chriſtiani Milites, Apoſtarae Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liani ſtatuas honorare non detrectarunt: &amp; hac eorum voluntate
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:57387:139"/>ſimplici abuſus eſt aſtutus Apoſtata, dum cum ſuis, Deorum Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines conjunxit, atque in eâdem tabellâ pingi curavit, ut dum ſuas colerent, Deos falſos unà coluiſſe viderentur. Prudentiores fraude obſervatâ cingulum ſolvere maluerunt, quam civilem cultum Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratori perſolvere, cum Idololatrico conjunctum. Alii ſimpliciores ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hil mali ſuſpicati, &amp; Imperatoris imagines venerati ſunt, &amp; eis, ut mos erat, thus adoleverunt. De quo vide Theodoretum l. III. hiſt. C. XVI. Sozomenum &amp; Nazianzenum Invect. I. in Julianum, pag LXXXV. &amp; ſequentibus, ubi refert, quam nobili Fidei ſuae confeſſione, cum perfidiae Impiiſſimi Apoſtatae deteſtatione maculam ſibi inuſtam eluerint, Chriſtiani milites.</p>
                     <p>Ubi nota, quod quando ſolus cultus civilis exhibebatur, eum unà cum Rege, cui debebatur, interiiſſe: ſic conjux a lege Viri teſte Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolo, ſubditi ab obedientiâ Regi ſuo debitâ, cujuſque morte liberan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur. Secus, ubi in ſacrum, atque Religioſum tranſivit, quia ipſorum Sacerdotes, aliique Miniſtri adeò non extingui permittebant, ut etiam augere conarentur, quaſi aucta foret ipsâ ex hoc mundotranſlatione Numinis Poteſtas, cum humanis exemptum, caelo ſideribuſque dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum eſſet, &amp; major eſſet è longinquo Majeſtas. Hinc factum credo, ut praeter communes cunctis Idololatris Graecorum Deos, Jovem, dico, Neptunum, Plutonem, variae gentes ſuos nactae ſint. Sic in Oriente Bel, in Syriâ Adad, &amp; Azael, ut ait Joſephus l. IX. Antiq. Jud. C. II. In Aegypto Oſyris, Iſis, Serapis, Apis. Saturnus, Janus, Romulus, ſive Quirinus, &amp; Flora, Romae, Trojae, Hector, Delphis Apollo, in Chio Ariſtaeus, in Samo Liſander, in Siciliâ Niobe Narriae Viridianus, Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coli Ancaria, Volſinii Nertia, Sutrini Nutria, alii alibi. Enimverò ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metſi de ſingulis dicere non poſſimus, quo modo eorum cultus aut primùm introductus, aut poſtea propagatus ad poſteros fuerit, is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men quem diximus maximè veroſimilis viſus eſt.</p>
                     <p>Tertia cauſa ſtatuas erigendi fuit gratus in benè de ſe, deque hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mano genere, ſive de Patriâ meritos animus.

Deinde interveniente tempore convaleſcente iniquâ conſuetudine, hinc error tanquam lex cuſtoditus eſt, &amp; Tyrannorum imperio, colebantur figmenta. Et hos, quos in palam honorare non poterant, propter hoc quod longè eſſent, è longinquo fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gura eorum allata, evidentem imaginem Regis, quem honorare volebant, fecerunt: ut illum, qui aberat, tanquam praeſentem colerent, ſuâ ſolicitudine, Provexit au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem ad horum culturam, &amp; hos, qui ignorabant, Artificis eximia diligentia. Ille enim volens placere, illi, qui ſe aſſumpſerat, elaboravit arte ſuâ, ut ſimilitudinem in melius figuraret. Multitudo autem hominum aebductae per ſpeciem operis, eum, qui ante tempus tanquam homo honoratus fuerat, nunc Deum aeſtimaverunt. Et haec fuit vitae humanae deceptio: quoniam aut Affectui, aut Regibus ſervientes homines, incommunicabile nomen lapidibus, &amp; lignis impoſuerunt.</hi> Haec ibi. Quae cauſas varias continent ab iis quas praecedenti Sectione retuli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus planè diverſas.</p>
                     <p>Prima eſt affect us in conſanguineos. <hi>Acerbo luctu dolens Pater, citò ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bi rapti filii fecit imaginem, eumque tanquam Deum colere caepit, &amp; conſtituit in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Servos ſuos ſacra, &amp; ſacrificia.</hi> De quo Minutius: <hi>Sic ſacra facta ſunt, quae fuerant inventa ſolatia.</hi> Ex Saliano obſervavi ſupra, non ſolos Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tres filiis ſuis; ſed etiam filios Patribus ſtatuas conſtituiſſe, eorumque cultum ſacrum propagaſſe tametſi ſolùm Patrum hic fiat mentio, ob rationem alibi datam.</p>
                     <p>Similis affectus cauſa fuit, quod Antinous puer Bithinicus ob ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularem formae elegantiam Adriano Caeſari gratiſſimus, ab ipſo, tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plo Mantinaeae conſtructo cultus fuerit, &amp; caelo, ſyderibuſque inſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus.

Hinc Minerva ob repertum La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificium, Ceres ob panis, Dionyſus, ſive Bacchus, ob vini uſum, Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canus ob fabrilem autem; Romulus, quod aeternam Urbem condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſſet: Flora, quod eandem ſuis opibus ditaſſet, Larentia, quod Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulum, &amp; Remum expoſitos nutriſſet, Stercutius, ſive Sterquilinus, quod agros ſtercorare docuiſſet, mutinus item ſive Matunus, aliam ob cauſam (vide Tertul.

Hoc enim faecit, &amp; quodammodo extorquet illa figura membro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum, ut animus vivens in ſenſibus corporis, magis arbitretur ſentire corpus, quod ſuo ſimillimum videt, quam rotundum ſolem, undaſque diffuſas, &amp; quid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid non iiſdem lineamentis formatum conſpicit, quibus illa formata ſunt, quae viventia videre conſuevit.</hi> Eteum dixiſſet, apud nos, Chriſtianos, in honore eſſe vaſa Sacra, per quae Deo ſupplicamus, non tamen à nobis adorari, addit: <hi>Illa cauſa eſt maxima</hi> IMPIETATIS INSANAE, <hi>quod plus valet in affectibus miſerorum ſimilis viventi forma, quae ſibi efficit ſupplicari, quam quod eam manifeſtum eſt non eſſe viventem, ut debeat à vivente contemni. Plus enim valent ſimulachra ad curvandam infaelicem animam, quod os habent, oculos habent, aures habent, nares habent manus habent, pedes habent, quam ad corri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendam, quod non loquentur, non videbunt, non audient, non odorabunt, non con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trectabunt, non ambulabunt.</hi> Haec Auguſtinus.</p>
                     <p>Hinc factum arbitror, ut tametſi in Moſaici Tabernaculi, &amp; Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pli Hieroſolymitani Sacris ſtatuae Seraphinorum, &amp; aliorum etiam animalium ſimilitudines ſculptae collocatae fuerint, extra tamen ejuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modi ſepta Sacra aliquid ejuſmodi noſquam extiterit, imò ſeveriſſimè prohibitum fuerit aliquid illiuſmodi fieri. Sacerdotibus enim ſolis, atque Levitis patebat illa Templi pars, in quâ ſtatuae, oratus causâ, collocatae erant: quibus, nempe Levitis, non magnum erat ab Idolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latriâ

Unde fieri poterat, ut in iis enunciandis nec fallerentur ip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſi, nec alios fallerent. Aliquando tamen etiam in his falla nunciabant, ut habetur in Actis B.

Baſilius Epiſt. ad Julianum Apoſtatam, poſſquam de cultu Chriſto Domino, Deiparae Virgini, aliiſque Sanctis debito, &amp; à ſe exhibito locutus eſt, ſubjungit: <hi>Vnde &amp; Characteres Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginum ipſorum honoro, &amp; adoro: praecipuè cum hoc à</hi> SANCTIS APOSTOLIS TRADITUM SIT. B. Hieronymus in Epitaphio S. Paulae c. III. dicit, illam proſtratam ante crucem, quaſi pendentem in eâ Dominum cerneret, adoraſſe. Plures alii Patres in hujus veritatis confirmationem citantur in Synodo VII. generali, Act. IV. Ubi videri poſſunt etiam varia miracula à Deo per interceſſionem Sanctorum facta. Vnde hujus veritatis confirmationem certiſſimam colligo: nec enim Deus ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitioſum, illicitumve cultum, multò minus Idololatricum, unquam conſirmavit, ne tanti Peccati Auctor cenſeretur.</p>
